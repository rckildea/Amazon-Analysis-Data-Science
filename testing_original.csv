There is a modest amount of interesting and humorous commentary, as well as factoids spread throughout. The bulk of the book, however, is the magazine ads, grouped two to four per page. A few ads are given bigger treatment. The problem I have will be obvious to anyone over 40: It is too small. The copy is very hard to read, and that makes it terribly frustrating. Apparently, the publishers predicted only young people would be interested in magazine ads from the forties thru sixties. Maybe coffee table size was proposed but thought to ambitious. I just can't read these cool little ads."""

I could not get into Twilight as the main girl cast Bella simply cannot act! She could not even cry when the love of her life breaks it off with her? And yes, I did read the books. Anyhow back to Vampire Diaries. There is a ton of Drama, Action and Suspense to keep you entertained. This series stars off at High School but quickly and cleverly steers clear of High School and into more complex issues and problems. I give this five stars as it reminds me a little of Anne Rice but has it's own unique style and again a fantastic well thought out story. Don't miss out without giving this a shot. One episode and you will be very interested. One disc and you will be hooked! Thanks for reading :)"""

They were grainy and seem to be just a flat copy over from DVD. True the picture hadmore pop and more vibrant color but that is expected of all bluray transfers because of the higher bit rate. Sound was good though and due to this I felt keeping them was justifiable else I would have just kept my DVD's Top Gun and days of thunder. War Of The Worlds and Collateral is still decent flicks as well if the cost is worth it. As you can see I'm clearly mixed with this package."""

3649931,"2,""Not that great"",""We bought James last night while we already had battery operated Percy. James does not run as well on Melissa and Doug train track as he does on original Thomas train track. He is also more sensitive going around curves. It seems to be the middle wheel.

3649937,"2,""Chess Mysteries is no Mystery."",""THE CHESS MYSTERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by Raymond M. Smullyan was predictable from beginning to end. Immediately Dr. Smullyan admits he doesn't like or play chess yet proceeds to use chess as a vehicle to demonstrate 'retrograde analysis' as though it were unique to chess. Any human being who has mastered his trade, craft, or profession has probably routinely reconfigured his work to identify a prior characteristic. Retrograde analysis is common to anyone skilled at their occupation and the adroit have no need to read this book to learn a commonly acquired skill. (The unadroit will simply continue as they are.) I further think this book will disappoint both chess players and Sherlock Holmes fans, and contribute nothing for students of logic."""

The puzzles are pretty challenging, and it definitely helps if you play chess. You tend to notice positional abnormalities that are the bases of the problems. From there, it's just detective work.But the real treat to this book is the world the author creates. Smullyan's characters can't play chess for nuts. You should see the bizarre positions they come up with - it's as though they're making random moves. Yet this doesn't diminish their love of the game one bit. They're such gentlemen too. No one minds when Dr. Holmes interrupts to ask questions. His new friends are always polite and like nothing more than a good demostration of deductive reasoning. I wish I lived in their world."""

Wiccan, on the opposite end of the spectrum belief-wise, is a nature-based religion whose main creed (the Wiccan Rede) is """"An it harm none."""" Witches use magick, yes, but not to harm anyone.

Architectonic refinement, meditative phrasing without any single bit of delirious Romanticism. His performances are contemplative rather than visceral, he played the piano like an entomologist , searching the perfect balance of musicality and expression. His limpid phrasing and specially one of his most reminded personal trademarks: to leave the bar floating to create an introspective atmosphere.If you are looking for a hyper Romantic Chopin, forget about it. Michelangeli enhanced and expressed wisely new angles of performing the beloved son of Poland.I would like to remark, there are other players who has followed this fabulous approach; Alfred Cortot, Samson Francois, Ivan Moravec (pupil of Benedetti) and Dinu Lipatti, among the most representative ones."""

3649985,"3,""My son loved it, until it broke :("",""My 2 year old is a serious Thomas fan. He loved this battery powered train. While it's pretty durable, ours completely stopped working after only 2 months. The motor just wore out and came to a halt on the tracks one day. We were very disappointed. My son was heart broken and I was annoyed because these are not cheap. We will probably buy another one because it was one of his favorite toys. I just expected better quality from such an expensive toy."""
3649986,"2,""The only Thomas pc. that has disappointed us"",""My son was initially thrilled to get this addition to his figure eight set, but once the novelty wore off, it seemed like more aggrevation that it was worth. For starters, once he saw battery operated Thomas do his thing, my son no longer wished to push the trains around the track himself. The durability is not great - we are about to return our second to Learning Curve. The second was even worse than the first - after only a few turns around the track it would not go up ascending track even by itself. This would frustrate my son considerably. The noise it creates is also considerable for such a small toy. Again, the second was worst than the first. We adore all our other pieces but my recommendation would be to skip this one and let your children push their own toys! --Update - We are about to send back Thomas for the third time. My son has grown tired of his always broken battery operated Thomas and has gone back to pushing his own trains."""
3649987,"1,""Broke very quickly"",""Broke down very quickly, because it is not possible to push it, the gears are engaged and when the power is switched off and pushed it grinds the gears. Some it started getting jammed very quickly, it would take a lot of hassle to get it going on its own again. I guarantee this will break very quickly, unless you do not let your kid play with it."""
3649988,"3,""Too loud and underpowered"",""We have two of the big BRIO battery engines, and they really pull the trains around. This Thomas train is underpowered and simply can't make it up the hills; plus it is incredibly loud with a brain-numbing """"grinding"""" sound as it chugs.This train frequently takes a """"time out"""" on top of the refrigerator."""

Since I am not from Boston, never been to Boston, and never will ever go to Boston, it was good for a one time viewing only.I agree with others that the cover of the DVD is misleading. I think that they purposely designed it to look like these people are actually performing routines, as an attempt to sell more copies, nationwide. Most people are pretty self centered and could care less about local comedy in an area other than their own.I give it two and a half stars. I thought that it would actually have some funny scenes in it and was disappointed when there was not any."""

Depending on how much stock you put in Harrison's well-conceived and sufficiently supported (in my opinion) thoery, it can be construed to either add to or take precedence over Diamond's GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL. I think together these books help to explain the world's current political situation (mess). Unlike Diamond's """"geography is fate"""" analysis, much can be accomplished politically to correct Harrison's """"culture is fate"""" explanation. Culture relativists, hackneyed liberals, and Bushian neo-cons will all take offense - that in itself may be sufficient reason to read it. The writing and editing could have been better, but because there were many contributors this is somewhat excusable."""
