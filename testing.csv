0,2,"If you liked getting scammed by Comcast's ""You don't have to do a thing when Digital arrives"" then you'll love the Series2","The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital. Now that Comcast has gone all-digital, your Series2 has become more like a Series0.50, since it only records one channel at a time."
1,1,Didn't work,I purchased this tivo from amazon. After hooking everything up I plugged it in and it did not work. No lights or sounds at all. I called tivo's customer service line and they said it would need to be exchanged. I will now have to pay $20-25 for shipping plus packaging materials to send it back and then wait a few weeks for a new one.
2,4,Tivo is an excellent product.,"I tried out Tivo because of the special promotion offered by Amazon. A Tivo and a $100 gift certificate was offered for $100. So far for the past month, my wife and I enjoyed the features of Tivo. We like the options of the season pass, freezing programs, rewinding, and skipping commercials.With the gift certificate, we didn't have to tie ourselve to a 1 year contract, and the value of the certificate is good for 6 months. We are are still evaluating the product and have not made a decision whether we will continue the service after 6 months because of the service cost of $17 a month.So far we like, and we would recommend it."
3,1,Burned Up!,"Be advised before you buy a TiVo product.I bought this item from Amazon but when it arrives I find that I need to connect to the TiVo Service to complete the setup (can't use device until setup is complete). I don't have a house phone and the network is on the other side of the house so I go to Best Buy and get TiVo wireless connector.Upon getting the wireless set up it tells me that it can't find my network so I call Technical Support. Support tells me that I have to set up an account with TiVo and pay them $12.95/mo so I can use my own machine. I don't want the service. All I want to do is use the DVR. ""Well,"" the lady says, ""if you don't sign up for the service the machine won't work."""
4,1,Tivo Service RIP OFF,"Hello All,If you were ever planning to get a Tivo remember one thing. The customer service stinks! It is easier to have a root canal than dealing with their customer service department. Once turn on you will have to cancel your credit card to have them stop charging it.Don't get me wrong I love the service but don't expect any help from their customer service department, plus get one of those ""Prepaid"" credit card to pay for the service, because if you use a real one they wont stop charging it."
5,1,Quite a snag here...,"When I received my new TiVo I rushed right in to install and play with my new ""toy"". The instructions were clear and I followed them to the letter. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the second of the ""dual-tuner"" channels working. After many hours and much fiddling I gave up and called customer service. As it turned out my RF input was not working properly; however, I found out something extremely important. New laws require that all signals be digital beginning in 2009. Many providers are currently in the process of changing over now, and according to the customer service rep. the second channel of the ""dual channel"" system is analog only and therefore useless in the new digital environment. I was not made aware of this fact when I purchased the unit as it would have made a definite difference in my decision to purchase it."
6,1,Buyer Beware,"When you order a Tivo with a one-year service term, Tivo promises to send you an e-mail 30 days prior to the end of the year before charging your credit card. Well, I never received an e-mail from Tivo, and customer ""service"" refused to issue a refund after I discovered the charge. Remember, you're not just buying a DVR, you're buying a service. Tivo's service sucks. Period."
7,4,very good,"I bought this as a gift for my parents and while I haven't actually seen it in action, they tell me they love it and will never go back to normal tv. The only caveat is that it must be connected to the Internet, and if you don't have an Ethernet cable that you can easily plug into the back, make sure you get the wireless adapter that goes with it (sold separately of course)."
8,5,Time Warner sucks. TiVo ROCKS.,"My old TiVo is still alive and kicking. Got him as a gift about 8 years ago and bit the bullet and bought lifetime service. Best money I've ever spent. We have other TWC dvrs in the house; always having problems with on demand video, slow relays, delayed remote responses, playback of recorded shows. NEVER have these problems with TiVO. He's changed my life!"
9,2,can do anything with it unless i buy more,"without internet, an external network adapter from tivo and a subscription the only thing i can do with this is pause and rewind live tv, the dvr cant work without a steady internet connection for the box. Due to copyright laws tivo has to erase cirtain recordings in order to preserve the time limits of cirtain shows. So far i have not been able to get live tv to go through my tivo box provided by comcast, so our provider wants to send a tech to my home and charge us $30 to take a look at things. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this product unless you are commited to the idea of going all the way."
10,5,An explanation of just what TiVo is for you newcomers,"Length:: 3:45 MinsIn this video, I explain just what a TiVo is, how it works, and why it is TOTALLY AWESOME."
11,3,Taking a step backward,"This really isn't Tivo's fault but a certain cable provider who is going all digital. So buyer-beware. Before purchasing the dual tuner (which I have loved and used because I'm a TV-aholic) make sure it works with your cable service. Because, now that I am forced to receive all my TV channels digitally I no longer have a dual-tuner Tivo but a single-tuner Tivo. SO FRUSTRATING! So you may want to save your money anod not consider buying the dual tuner unless you know for sure that it will work.Now my only option - if I want to watch one show and tape another - is to dust off the VCR (still have it - can I find tapes?) or buy another Tivo. Darn cable company! (Would switch to satellite if I could but I rent and it's not allowed.)"
12,2,Live and Learn,Bought the Tivo 80 hr. Video Recorder to hook up to a security camera. Was advised it should work. Tuner arrived with no instructions and full of previous owner's old recordings. Could not get instructions on TiVo's internet site and have not yet been able to get it to work. We keep getting error msg. that we have to be a TiVo subscriber to use it. Will probably just throw it in the trash where it belonged in the first place.
13,1,Return,I do not have any problems with Amazon...But I have problem with FireWallSalesNew York.I had return this TIVO almost three weeks ago. I had wrote tothem and I told them that I had sent it back due they was going to charge me$20.00 a month.I have Dish TV and they harge only me $6.00 a month. Ihad wrote to them different times to see if they got my TIVO.They writeback to tell that they will let me know.Now it's going to a month and stillhave not resolved the problem.I think that I am going to better businessin the state of New York.I am very upset with this company.They have noPride if they did they would of taken care of me......Noris
14,1,Completamente disgustado,"Cuando me entusiasme en comprar el TCD649080 en ninguna parte pude observar que para poder grabar los programas de TV nececitaba pagar una suscripcion ni tompoco se me notifico que solo era para uso exclusivamente en USA. Lo compre con una direccion en Fort Loderdale por intermedio de un amigo piloto, quien me lo trajo. El equipo , claro, llego muy bien, pero por lo anteriormente dicho me encuantro muy disgustado porque siente que perdi mi dinero.When I get excited in buying the TCD649080 in any part I could observe that to be able to record the programs of TV nececitaba to pay a subscription neither tompoco I am notified that single era for use exclusively in it USES. Buy it with an address in Fort Loderdale through a friend pilot who brought it to me. The team, clear, arrives very well, but for the previously this thing me very upset encuantro because it feels that I lost my money."
15,3,Muriel Still Sparkles,"""Aiding and Abetting"" has Muriel Spark's trademark lightness and deftness of style. It isn't one of her deepest books, and it lacks the poignancy of her best work; but she still sparkles. As we Muriel Spark Groupies know, she has had a lifelong fascination with the theme of the wrong person (from the murderer's point of view - from the victim's point of view, of course, it's always the wrong person) being murdered by mistake, because that's what almost happened to her when she was a young woman. I wonder if this is the reason this true-crime story appealed to her. I also see echoes of Evelyn Waugh in this book; this is meant as praise, not criticism. I miss the undercurrent of the supernatural, especially the sinister characters who may or may not be demons, that characterizes her best work. For those reading Muriel Spark for the first time, I recommend my favorite of all her books, ""A Far Cry From Kensington."" You won't be disappointed."
16,2,Disappointing,"A vividly imagined tale of what might have been had the infamous Lucky Lucan (wanted for murder) come to Paris with his body double, settled in for overpriced psychotherapy with a former fake stigmatic and ultimately ended up sealing his fate in a most unexpected (and unbelievable) way. Although clever in places, witty in spots, I found this book a quick read primarily because I wanted to be finished with it quickly. The characters were brittle and unsympathetic. The scenes artificial. The book flowed like a swift stream, confident even cocky in places, but lacking the kind of depth that makes you want to dive in and swim."
17,2,Not up to par,"I have long been a fan of Muriel Spark's, truly enjoying her humor and style. I liked her autobiography as well. But this book is a great disappointment. The characters are shallow: in particular, Dr. Wolf is cardboard and scarcely believable. There is a certain sense of haste: events are barely sketched, and it is all quickly brought to a conclusion, without going into any detail. A very thin book indeed, which would probably have received much less attention if the author did not have such a reputation."
18,3,A bit repetitive and a lot strange,"I am a big Muriel Spark fan and I know her characters can be a bit quirky and the conversation a little surreal. That said, this was TOO much that way. It came off as stilted. The main characters were shallow and (as I saw noted in other reviews) the book was somewhat repetitive. I did stick with it to the end, but only because it was pretty short and didn't take much time. I am a Brit and was a teenager at the time of this crime, so I do remember it and also remember the ""upper class"" entitlement thing that was in its last throes in the 70s. Still - just a so-so read and not up to this author's usual standard."
19,5,A witty mystery...,"A mystery filled with wit, and based on the famous Lord Lucan case (a murderer who escaped, and to this day, no one knows if he's alive or dead). Spark has not lost her touch, and this is a short, engaging book that you won't want to put down."
20,2,repetitive and boring,"this comes from someone who knew nothing of the legend of lord lucan.. but still.. from the opening of the story i was intrigued by it. however, the book is constantly repeating the few details that it shares with us on the crime and lord lucan's disappearance over and over again. i felt the book to be very incomplete. the key word here is repetitive. It's just a bore! Pass it! (the last two sentences being the only in need of capitalization)"
21,2,An exquisitely-made little jewel-like box-- unfortunately em,"I kept getting the feeling as I read this book that I was supposed to be impressed by its elegance--an elegant, exotic heroine, living in Paris. Not one, but two men claiming to be an internationally-famous criminal. Spare, sophisticated prose and dialogue. But I just couldn't make myself be interested in the characters or the plot.I can't be more specific without revealing more of the plot, but I just couldn't feel that the plot was interesting or believable. The characters were so sparely drawn that I just couldn't care about them. Perhaps if I were a Muriel Sparks junkie, I might be more excited, but I just wasn't."
22,2,"Cynical Farce, Unbelievable and not that Funny","there are some uproarious jokes in this novel, but they are few and far between. the rest is a furious but empty chase, for money and protection which has the merit of speed alone. it begins and then it is over. the main characters are motivated by selfishness and greed. there is nothing likable here. and as a meditation on faith, the aptness of false-healers, idiot lying priests, and medicine-magic, the novel is disgusting and shallow."
23,2,disappointed,"I was excited to find a Christian-based sitcom to enjoy with my children. We watched them. They definitely were Christian based, but they were annoying. These are definitely not role models for my girls. I would not want my girls acting like them. The one is so loud and flighty. They both seem really into themselves and very superficial. I would love for more Christian sitcoms to become available, but this one did not make the cut for me. I'm disappointed. I had such high hopes."
24,1,Terrific music. Horrible disc!,"This disc is a third-rate BOOTLEG, with horrible sound quality. You can get this material in far better quality through trading. Don't be a ""sucker""!"
25,1,BOOTLEG - DO NOT BUY!,"For whatever reason this deplorable bootleg has not been pulled from the market, nor has bootleg vendor OZIT been sued yet. If you want to hear the real, legitimate, officially released BAT CHAIN PULLER, please buy the edition that the Zappa Family Trust is releasing as of February 2012. Don't say you weren't warned about this shoddy ripoff!"
26,5,This is the only available version of BCP and is good that it is released,"Despite all the protestations by others, I personally love the cover and artwork and the fact that we can finally hear supposedly from the tape that Don sent to UK promoter Roger Eagle something like Bat Chain Puler should have sounded. thios album is raw and energetic work from the captain and his Magic Band. Definitely worth buying."
27,3,It would be better if this guy could write,"I'm a regular reader of all sorts of books on math, and so Gnomon seemed a natural for me. I have a master's degree in computer science (bachelors, too, but i digress) and this sort of thing is right up my alley. The book doesn't really cover any new ground, but it does gather separate things into one volume, which makes it nice as a reference. The biggest problem with the book is with the actual text. This guy can't write. Yes, the material is technical, yes it's slow going, but that is no excuse for poorly structured arguments and incoherent organization of the material.It's all here, but you'll need to work through it slowly and try to infer what he means because he leaves out a bunch of foundation work."
28,3,Classic Wartime Fiction For Kids,"My friend got this for me for a buck at a yard sale. As a fan of aircraft of this era, I read this story with interest. While obviously meant for kids, the publication date of 1942 made it of historical interest to me. It was fascinating to read about the air war over Great Britain during a time it was still very much real."
29,1,can't get any worse,i guess i expect to much out of a cd these days. i only want to hear good songs and good music. i was sadly disappointed in this cd. predictable and boring.save your cash.
30,2,*Thumbs Down*,"This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one."
31,1,Ordinary pop is right.,"I like pop music, but I don't want to be bored by it. Jason Mraz is at least interesting musically. I have to agree with the others, this record doesn't quite cut it for me."
32,4,How can you call this CD terrible?,"I'm seeing all these reviews say how awful this CD is. It's a truly amazing CD. ""fake a Smile"" was not a great choice for a single, and it is a somewhat boring song. ""Dead Heart"" and ""Out of The Dark"" are definitely the stand out tracks on this record and are worth the $10 by themselves. Buy The CD. It's one of the best of 2004."
33,1,Judge a Book by Results,"I purchased this book over a year and a half ago, and I have yet to win big. I have studied this book from cover to cover, and use it with Lotto:How to Wheel a Fortune,also by Gail Howard. Anyone who considers purchasing either book should know that the majority of the jackpot winners in her testimonial section are from the late eighties. In theory, Lottery Master Guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds, but sad to say, I do not feel it lives up to its claims. I personally, would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book."
34,5,Great Introduction To The Lottery,If you are new to playing lottery then this is the book to get. Plenty of charts to get you thinking and analyzing numbers so you can create your OWN systems. I highly recommend this book for all beginning lottery enthusists.
35,3,Great theories and things to see weakness in the Lotto system,"This book does give lots of tools to analyze the lotto numbers and when it will come out at the drawings. Anything from lower/higher and even/odd to chances a lotto number will come out. All the theory is all good but I haven't found any good results using it. The book is well written for entertainment purpose but the results are no different from doing Quickpick or manual picks on your own. After trying the theories out, I haven't didn't noticed any good results.The process is very time consuming.Save your money and time,buy more lotto tickets instead.I was too foolish to even try it."
36,5,Play to Win,"First of all - you need to play to win. Using Gail's books and software can make the winning happen. Some people see patterns and trends very easily using the information and charts available to them in her books and software. Others need to study harder. I've used Gail's books and software for a long time now, and although I haven't hit the ""big one"" YET, it's just around the corner. These tools can make it happen! As Gail says, ""Smart Luck!"""
37,3,lotto picks,"This book is very interesting and informative! However , in my opinion, there are too many variables with this system to predict any type of winning stratagies. My original thoughts that you cannot predict winning number combos without spending a ton of money still stands."
38,4,A little Difficult,"I like the book so far. It gets a little complicated. So, I have to re-read some of the tips, etc. I'm going to win Florida Fantasy 5! Yes!:)~Jeniffer"
39,4,Much to enjoy in this unfamiliar composer's works.,"Weyse's (1774-1842) symphonies sound similar to the middle symphonies of Mozart. None rise to the greatness of Mozart's last six symphonies, but all are enjoyable, with graceful minuets and dramatic finales. The Royal Danish Orchestra under Michael Schonwandt never misses a step, in well-groomed mannered performances. Perhaps the best analogy I can draw is that Weyse is to Mozart as Ferdinand Ries is to Beethoven."
40,2,A decent enough OSV,"Aside from a few tracks, namely the memorable airship theme and few others, the CD isn't much more than a novelty; something to add to your collection. But look at it this way - it's Uematsu! Really, you can't much go wrong there..."
41,1,NOT GOOD! do not even waste the 2.00 for the 7 day trial,"I have been trying to find videos I can play on my Amazon Prime Roku box for my kitties. I have one really great video, Feline Frolics, which I Highly recommend. This one, however, is terrible. It starts out with a bunch of ducks and goes on and on and on and on..with the ducks. The sounds are ok but get very annoying after awhile. They have, of all things, a turtle. ( blinks) I am not sure why they have a turtle..They also have a crocodile.. and only 1 short scene of an aquarium!! ~ and that one was at the end. The scenes are entirely too long to keep my cats attention and are exceedingly boring. I am SO glad I didn't purchase the full version. Do not waste your money..... Amazon please find more cat movies to show on PRIME.. I love the Frolics one!!!"
42,1,BAD SELLER!!!,"Fast shipping, but none of the 10 discs I bought worked. I tried different speeds, burners, and ISO's. I tried to contact Amazon and also the seller but got no response. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
43,1,Resie This!,"Give it up everyone, Rammstein is dead. This album is so soft it doesn't even deserve to be a German based CD. Not even Rosenrot can save this album.They have sold-out, producing a soft, nu-metal tainted record that can't compare to their other amazing albums.RIP RAMMSTEIN"
44,3,Improv,"There's not much going on in this CD other than mindless background music. It's mostly all improv, and while it's tolerable, it's nothing special at all. The vaguest of themes is hinted at in the tiniest of ways and some tracks have a touch of feeling to them but nothing to impress significantly.If you want a CD in which a few lesser genres such as jazz, blues and mellow get the weakest of workouts then go ahead and get it. A excellent example of modern day video-gaming scoring it certainly is NOT."
45,5,"Like ""Angela's Ashes,"" only well-written!","I had not expected 'Never Piss Into The Wind' to packsuch an emotional punch- a punch softened with humorand great wit. This is a homerun, a must read. I willbe sending copies of this jewel to family members forChristmas this year."
46,1,"Really bad, cheesy comedy","The acting was bad, especially those of the supporting characters. The actors weren't helped by some awful dialog. The plot was rediculous, though some of that was intentional. The low-budget special effects were silly, and not in a good way. In short, don't waste your money on this stinker."
47,2,Disappointing,"Weak story, Characters were not interesting or engaging and Vampire rules were silly. Also tired of the Gay=slutty and incapable of an adult relationship. Can't we do better?"
48,3,better than I thought,"This show is packed with familar faces and I was surprised and delighted to see Rose Marie in one episode and happy that she had more than one scene. I do wish it was clearer, but again, this may be just as clear as what was originally viewed with some TV sets of that time. I was pleasantly surprised at the show itself and I think I may get more episodes."
49,1,Dorman HELP! 38419 Door Hinge Pin and Bushing Kit,I ordered 2 of these door hinge pin kits which include the bushings and clip. One package came taped up. Today I was preparing to install these door pins I noticed the black clip was missing from the taped up package. I ran to 2 different hardware stores to find a clip. Neither store had this item.I had to halt my installation today and will run to an auto parts store to buy a whole new kit so I can get the installation done.There is no contact for the seller so I will now have to eat my cost on this kit. Plus it's much cheaper at the auto parts store.
50,4,Almost Perfect!!!,Very Fast shipping. Product arrived in perfect condition. Pins were a perfect fit. Washers were all same size there should be one slightly larger than the other per set... No big deal though.... since the washers do not move for proper door functionality I simply wrapped the smaller washer with electrical tape to give it a snugg fit and it works perfectly fine.... other than that small but fixable detail ... Perfect!!
51,2,Not for chevy s10 pickup,"One bushing fits the other doesnt, I chose to make it fit....will implode into itself seeing as its brass and squeak to caboose but its better than your door not shutting."
52,1,Incorrect parts in package,I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
53,5,Does what it says,"I bought this product for my 98 Chevy S10. It fits great, and it's nice not to have to lift my door up to close it anymore. It doesn't really look exactly like the picture, but I think that's just a generic picture for all the hinge kits. Make sure you put it in from the bottom for the top hinge if yours is like mine. There isn't room to do it from the top, and your hammer can slip and crack your windshield if you're not careful. Otherwise it's a no brainer to put in. All you'll need is a hammer and some pliers."
54,5,You Gotta' Love It!!!!!,"I have always loved Buffy, since her first dusting, to the tragic events of Joyce Summers. This is a pair of my favorite episodes, the only others are ""Hush"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" Buy it!!!! you'll love it, trust me on this one!"
55,3,Billy Connelly,"It is a good show - not as funny as some of his earlier stuff, but still pretty good."
56,4,"Funny stuff, BUT ...","... with the exception of two bits, this is NOT the material we saw at the Too Old to Die Young performance at 37 Arts in NYC.I have mixed feelings, because I had a chance to see some other great material on the DVD; but I was disappointed, because I REALLY wanted to have a chance to re-live some hilarious moments we saw live.If you're looking to get a video of the NYC performances, this isn't it. If you're looking for some fresh, fun stuff from Billy, it's right here."
57,1,Billy Connolly; Live in New York,Little Disapointed seems to be old material from all his other videos Just an older Billy on stage
58,2,I was a little disappointed...,"It had been a while since I had heard his jokes and standup show. But I did not find this DVD as funny as I expected it.Yes, O'Connolly is unpredictable, but not ""Robin Williams"" umpredictable. It seems more as if he rambles around, goes on the tangent and forgets what he was talking about, and then his jokes lose momentum.Something no one has mentioned is that the producers did not put a lot of effort in the CD. There are no ""Chapters"" to identify the main themes of the show. For foreign speakers or hearing impaired, there are no closed captions. There are no extras. Nothing. It's just a DVD which says ""Play"", and there you go...Hopefully this helps you in your decision."
59,1,Not Funny,"Billy Connolly: Live in New York is a poor recording of his comedic talent both artistically and professionally. The stage set looks drab and poorly lit, much like an amateur would do on his first chance of recording finger puppets for a kindergarten class. The comedian's appearance matches that of the set, leaving his grey hair standing out as if he just stepped out of the shower. His comedy material seems impromptu, with digressions that never establishes ""The Roll"" in any of his comedy bits, stories or subjects, throughout his comedy act. To be frank, I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through the DVD and decided to use the DVD as a beverage coaster instead.I originally purchased the DVD based upon samples of his material I've heard from Satellite Radio, and I believe that there are far better recordings of this artist besides this DVD title."
60,1,Billy Connolly suitable to under 5s,"Unlike all other Billy Connolly dvds; this one failed to offend Catholics, Muslims, women, gays, schoolteachers,foreigners and the 'Good English' Society. My wife,children and our local priest were not offended by this 'Big Yin'offering.This is suprising for a Clydeside comedian who has a 'no taboo' regime with his comedy.the reason that no offense was taken is simple.DVDs from USA do not work in the UK.Oh yes it took yonks to deliver and the girls at work got a bit spooked with the packaging from Frankfurt airport.Fingerpost in St Helens is still at war with the Hun.It does have a nice box though!"
61,3,"Good, but repetitive","Part of Billy Connolly's act is that of a distracted old man; jump to another topic while in the middle of a story, and work his way back to it. I love the style because it adds humor, but i noticed something.This DVD uses alot of the material from 'Was it something i said?' Sure there are differences, but I paid for two seperate specials and got, like, 1.68 fresh comedy.B.C. is hilarious, but i just want to throw out that warning.Hope this helped! :)"
62,3,Billy Connolly: Live inNew York,Have been a Billy Connolly fan for a long time. This was funny but not as funny as some of his other work.
63,3,Not The Usual Billy Connolly!!!,This performance by Billy Connolly seems to have been toned down for a U.S. audience! Still enjoyed it very much though.
64,5,The Bible for Minimalism and its British origins,"For anyone wanting to discover what is minimalism and wher it came from, this a must. No one has managed to outline and seize precisely the essence of it as well as H. YPMA. Outstanding photos, and a fantastic insigt into London"
65,1,Made coffe sweet,I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste. I don't like sugar in my coffee. Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away. There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners. Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.
66,4,Taste Great,This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different. It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.
67,2,Odd fit,"The overall idea of the body suit was good however the fit not so much. I am about average hieght 5 6"" and weigh 130 but it seemed like it was made for a person smaller in stature. My guy was pleased with my appearance but the odd fit didn't make me feel as sexy as I wud have liked."
68,4,Hank Williams Hillbilly Hero boxed set,"This will give the casual listener some songs he may never have heard as well as the old Hank standards, but is not to be confused with The Complete Hank Williams boxed set. For some reason the songs recorded in 1952(and others) are not included. If this is not important to you, this is a great value at less than $20. The quality of the recording is excellent as is the packaging. Check out the other sets from Proper Records as each is a great value.Eddy's Song"
69,3,"Too Little, Far Too Late","During a season when there are some excellent books on college sports (Shulman and Bowen's Game of Life, and Murray Sperber's Beer & Circus), Duderstadt comes up with something of a dud (sorry for the pun). He calls for the reform of college sports but this is the guy who, as president of the University of Michigan, tolerated a special academic program, Sports Management, in which his jocks with academic problems were sheltered. It is really hard to take him seriously with a background like that. It's as if he has found religion--reform college sports.Good luck to him, and I suppose that any critic of big-time college sports should be congratulated for taking an unpopular stand but this book is too little and far too late."
70,4,Great Stuff,"I usually hear all kinds of new music while listening to the hardcore channels on www.di.fm or in this case, www.happyhardcore.com I really enjoy this fast (140bpm) type of music when I work out, though I like most electronic music in general. Personally, disc 1, mixed by SY is my favorite. I would say that it is mainstream happy hardcore. Disc 2 is more just hardcore/gabber. I find that disc 2 is more annoying than enjoyable to listen too. Disc 3, mixed by Kevin Energy, combines what the first two discs have to offer. Disc 3 starts out happy hardcore but flows towards the end of the CD into more hardcore rave like that found on disc 2. Overall, I like the set and to anyone looking to buy it, it would not be a waste of money in my opinion. The more I listen to it, the better it gets."
71,5,A must-read for attaining harmony with your horse.,"A classic aimed at the dressage rider yet applicable to all who desire a true partnership with their horse. Museler provides clear explanations and graphic illustrations on the training of the horse and rider from the basics of balance and feel to correcting disobedience and advanced training. First published in 1937, 'Riding Logic' provides practical steps to achieving the sympathetic partnership advocated by todays natural horsemen"
72,3,Awful Mursey,"I bought this because it was slim, compact, and I liked the way it looked. Little did I know that the product picture shown on the Website was the 2009 model and the bag I was sent was the 2010 model. I contacted ebags (the seller) with no help. The 2009 model had a large clasp on main compartment flap, with lots of pockets on the front of the bag; the 2010 model has 1 detachable pouch instead of many pockets and the main compartment flap velcro's shut. Also I have had 2 different people harass me about this bag being a murse (or man purse if you will) on two separate unrelated occasions. I would recommend hunting down a 2009 model on ebay over buying this bag."
73,4,Decent Option,"These flakes (often powdery) are better priced (even when ~$15 for 22 oz) than anything available near the metropolitan area where I live. Used to pour this on everything possible before I got sick of the taste, now I sprinkle for a hint of cheesy taste and B12/nutrition."
74,4,So Much Better Than the Dregs From the Bulk Bin,"This nutritional yeast is the same stuff that you can find in the bulk bins at many health food stores. The upside is that it hasn't been pawed through by a zillion shoppers before you and the canister that it comes in is so much sturdier and easier to store in your pantry than the flimsy plastic bags found in most bulk food aisles.The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is the ""small flake"" nutritional yeast instead of the ""large flake"" that I prefer. Plus, although it has a good ""cheesy"" flavor and is great for using when making vegan dishes or as a topping for popcorn, it does have a very slightly bitter flavor to it that in my experience, some other brands of nutritional yeast don't seem to have."
75,5,Kal Yeast makes for a great breakfast,"Blends very easily. Has a mild taste. I put a scoop of nutritional yeast in my breakfast blender shakes (also has water, powdered milk and frozen berries or other fruit, and a sweetener such as stevia). Gives a great nutritional boost - and all those B vitamins are great for the ""nerves' before a work day begins and I like the protein in it too. Have been taking yeast for 20 years - it did take a few weeks to get used to the taste when I began, since I only stirred it in milk. With the fruit and a little sweetener - it tastes really good."
76,5,yeast flakes,Just what I wanted came quickly. Highly recommend both this product and the supplier. Very satisfied. Only need 3 more words... Thanks!
77,2,I can't use this in place of parmesan cheese,"The taste is not what I expected - I expected it to taste good and I didn't like the flavor. I mixed it with pesto because I normally use parmesan. It ruined the pesto. Not a big fan of it as a cheese replacement, however, I'm using it as a nutritional supplement for home-made bread - the flavor doesn't come out in the bread. So for nutrition it's good, but not so good for taste."
78,3,Ok yeast flakes,"We, the family is not vegetarian but I thought we could use the natural vitamins that brewers yeast contain. It is hard for me to add it to finished food and even harder for me to remember to add it to the cooking stage. The taste and texture is very distinct and hard to disguise with traditional foods and taste."
79,2,Yeast Flakes,"Not sure what all to do with these...not working that well on popcorn...surely does not taste like a cheese substitute. Did not dissolve in hot water yet to use as a broth or drink...maybe that is the way to go but so far, not impressed and will probably NOT buy again."
80,2,wish I had bought the small can,"I really wanted to like this, but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to. I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in."
81,5,Love it,Far superior taste to what I've been buying in bulk at my local health food store. I'm a loyal Kal user now!
82,5,"Wrong Picture, Great Product.","Though the item that arrived was not this picture, it is the same 22 oz KAL Nutritional Yeast flakes I purchased before and I'm very satisfied. It takes a little while to get used to the taste but now I put it on pretty much everything. I agree it's slightly cheesy, a little salty tasting (to me), but I really do sprinkle it on pretty much everything savory or spicy. 3 TBS for 9 protein and it's just yummy. Great product, have purchased again, will purchase again."
83,5,Bulk size rocks,"Keep a small shaker flip top canister (I use the Red Star one) so you can refill when needed. Getting this jumbo size will save you a bundle, especially if you use a lot of yeast. The quality is good, and you can add it to many foods to increase nutritional value."
84,5,Perfect on popcorn! Healthy for you!,"It's difficult to find flakes of yeast. I like it on home-made popcorn fresh off the stove.It adds a buttery taste to it, and the flakes catch in the crooks and crevices of the popped corn.Discovered it in Portland, OR at an art theater downtown, where they had it in a shaker, next toparmesean cheese and salt, etc.About once a month I HAD to go to that theater, no matter what movie was showing,and have some popcorn with brewer's yeast on it. Finally figured out it was right beforemy menstral cycle, and my body craved B vitamins, which this stuff is packed full of.This is a big container of it, and should last quite a while.I'll tell you, finding FLAKED brewer's years is difficult way down here in my area."
85,4,Simple and direct teaching about a controversial topic,"There is a lot of disagreement over the topic this book discusses. I am thankful that RA Torrey does a great job of presenting how the baptism with the Holy Spirit works based on what Scripture teaches.He really does an excellent job explaining the following topics:1. What the Baptism is and what it does2. How the Baptism can be obtained3. Refilling with the Holy Spirit4. How spiritual power is lostGiven all the confusion and discussion about this doctrine, I think it is essential that Christians investigate the topic and decide what to believe. Torrey's book is an excellent starting point for those who seek to learn more."
86,2,It was just ok....,This video was just ok. I give it a D+ maybe a C-. Shaq's comedy series have been really good but this was not as good as the others.
87,3,Out of character,Apart from monique being a bit out of character and some of the comedians not bringing flavor to the stage it was OK. Not something you need to rush out and buy.
88,2,Not Impressed with Dallas,"I love comedy, but this particular video, in my opinion, has overplayed the use of foul language/cursing - no cussin. There was more cursing than real jokes. I was mostly disappointed with the host, Mo'Nique. The best comedian on this series by far was Paul Mooney, and Corey Holcomb bringing 2nd place. The others were ok, again in my opinion."
89,1,Not a Huge Fan,Monique was a bit to much. Didnt really enjoy her on the mic. Loved Paul Mooney piece it was way to short. And the last comedian Corey was funny. But I wouldnt recommend anyone else to buy it. If your buying it to hear Paul Mooney's Piece your better off waiting until his new stand comes out next month. Monique ruined the DVD.
90,1,A waste of time..,"Well for starters monique's stand up always involve male bashing because by the looks of her I can understand and the other comedians were garbage as well (except for paul mooney). This was by far the sorriest shaquille o'neal comedy video in his production, I definitely do not think this video was funny."
91,3,not his best,"as much as I like Silvio, this is not his best cd.I've been listening to his songs since I was almost a kid, I learned to play the guitar with his songs and spent long long nights in my teenager years singing under the sky and talking about how to change the world with friends...silvio has great songs, and amazing lyrics of course. Some of the songs in this album are ok, like mariposas and the new version of dias y flores (still, I like better the old version).Anyway, Silvio is still a wonderful singer and composer, his lyrics beautiful and politically compromised. This is not a bad album, but his other works are just great!So, if you are new to silvio, just get some of his old albums which are just great."
92,3,"Yes, it's okay","Yes it is okay, but I've seen better selections. It all boils down to personal taste. If I had nothing better to do it would be getting a better review, but I think I've spent more productive hours."
93,2,Would not recommend,Don't like most of these movies; description inadequate so I didn't have a way to know what type of movies were on it.
94,1,Not what it appeared to be,"The cover of this DVD shows Tarzan standing with a lion. The movie with Gordon Scott that featured that scene wasn't even one of the five movies. This is definitely not what it is portrayed as being. I was looking for Gordon Scott movies (in color), but these were black and white movies that featured several other ""Tarzans"". Only one had Gordon Scott in it, and it was not the movie that was pictured on the cover of the DVD. This was a birthday gift for someone who has been looking for Gordon Scott Tarzan movies for years, and I thought I had finally found the ""perfect"" gift.....not so."
95,5,Air Filter,"Excellent product and much less expensive than at the dealer. Shipped on time, easy instructions to replace old filter with the new one."
96,1,ruined my MAF sensor,I'have had this K&N; in my car for over 4 years. Yes it does increase gas mileage but it also ruined my MAF sensor after about 4 years. I did try cleaning it w/ MAF sensor cleaner which helped temporarly but i ended up getting a new MAF.I'll probably go with a high flow filter w/out oil next time.joe
97,3,Editorial distracts from facts,"I agree with Tanya. I found that this book offers a lot of useful information, but of which is effectively hidden from the American public. But the book would have been much more effective had it not be so editorialized and had it allowed the reader to ""decide for themselves"" what they think about the oil industry.I can somewhat forgive the author for the conclusion that the hydrogen fuel cells offer a lot of potential, given that the book was written in 2004. However, given the sizable barriers that the author cites and the fact that plug-in electric cars were not mentioned at all, I wanted to see some real data to support this case. Such data was nonexistent.All told, I don't think this is the best primer on the industry regardless of your political stance. I found ""The Rough Guide to the Energy Crisis"" much more fact-driven, though broader in scope. There are a number of other books on the topic and I encourage you to look elsewhere before reading this book."
98,5,"Even prettier than the ""garden faries' by Darcy Mae.","16 pages of beautiful, black and white illustrations on quality parchment paper. These are the coloring books I turn to when Im ready for something different to color. Personally speaking, I find these to be the most fun, and a great change of pace, because I can use almost any medium for terrific results, in far less time. I prefer using my Tombow markers with water applied, so I get that traslucent watercolor effect, then come back with either more felt marker, and or a soft colored pencil, and crayola crayons, hit it with a hot iron to melt the wax's into the paper for retaining bold yet translucent colors.( I like the buckling effect this also gives) Lot's of fun to color!! Great projects for kids and adults alike. These designs are also great for crafters."
99,4,Stained Glass Fairy Pages,"At first I was disappointed with my purchase, but after speaking with the seller, I have reprized my opinion of the business. The book slipped past his quality control, and he is making ammends to me. I get to keep the book I purchased, although not what I hoped for it will suffice and get a percentage off my next purchace. Thank you for being so custumer orientedRackham Fairy Tale Stained Glass Coloring Book (Dover Coloring Book)"
100,5,I love this tree!,"You can definitely see the pool in the middle--if you stick your head into the branches! =) I absolutely loooooooove this tree. It is so beautiful and came out of the box almost perfect--haven't even fluffed up the branches yet and it looks wonderful. There are so many lights--800! One thing though, the lights are LED so they don't have that soft yellow glow. Instead it's kind of an ice blue glow, like ice on the branches or very sparkly diamonds. So for those of you who are more interested in the soft yellow glow, don't get this tree. Other than that it's really bright--it lights up the whole room. Very nice tree. Would buy again."
101,1,"A Huge Dissapointment, Not a Complete Guide","I believe Al Ristori to be a well respected Fisherman who normally shares valuable information in a cut to the chase manner.But this book fails to live up to that reputation.It is definitely not a "" complete guide to Saltwater Fishing "".Almost all of the information presented in the book is cookie cutter and generic information that can easily be found on the net for free.This book was clearly not a labor of love and Al merely put his well know name on it to bank some coin......and has disappointed me in the process...."
102,2,The point,"I totally missed the point of the novel. Maybe I need a professor to explain the satire but I did not get it. I kept waiting for the story to tell me something about myself or about society - it never did. After reading some of your reviews, I am led to believe that I totally missed the boat. Did I really?"
103,5,CANDIDE - THE TRUE LOVER,"CANDIDE IS ONE THE BEST LOVE STORIES OF ALL TIMES. THE BOOK MADE ME LAUGH, CRY, HATE, BUT MOST ALL LOVE AND SEE THAT TRUE LOVE WILL ALWAYS FIND IT TRUE END. I WAS CAPTURED BY ALL THE CHARACTERS, AND PLACES IN THIS WONDERFUL BOOK. CANDIDE FORBIDDEN LOVE TO MADAME CONGANDE ROYALTY TO THIS COMMONER, CANDIDE. HIS QUEST TO FORGET AND YET BE UNITED TO HIS MOST BELOVED. PROFESSOR PENGLOSS OUT LOOK ON LIFE; THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS IN LIFE IS MEANT TO BE THAT WAY - SETS FORTH THE IDEOLOGY ""THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER OUR DESTINY."" COMPARE THAT WITH CONGONDE'S MILITARY BROTHER THAT BELIEVED THAT ONE CAN SET AND CONQUER ONES DESTINY.CANDIDE SHIPWRECKED EXPERIENCE IN ELDORADO WAS JUST GREAT, SHOWING THAT UTOPIA AND UNITY EXIST SOMEWHERE. BUT ALAS CANDIDE CHOSEN COURSE WAS TO LEAVE THIS PLACE OF PERFECT PEACE AND UNITY AND TO SEEK FOREVER HIS TRUE PEACE AND UNITY, HIS BELOVED MADAME CONGONDE.THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK SHORT AND SWEET I RATE THIS BOOK A TRUE CLASSICHENRY"
104,2,Candide represents the best of French Literature.,This book never should have made it into print past the eighteenth century. It has no sublety. Monty Python does a much better job of getting the point across without the typical French bitterness
105,2,"Neither Ironic nor Meaningful, Simply Dated","Call me a philistine, but ""Candide"" did more to confuse than enlighten me. Yes, I know the story is deliberately far fetched, almost surreal, but it still failed to make an impact even when considering the work in this context. Absurdity can only travel so far.My sad but brief review is that ""Candide"" is less meaningful today that it was at the time of its writing. No, I have not found the meaning of life but nor has Voltaire."
106,3,nice!,"this is good stuff. i'm not a big fan of the classics (if you can call this a classic). however, i read it in one sitting. a personal record for me. (although, i must mention, that i have a paper due on the book later today and that might of had some influence i'm my reading time). it's witty, funny, and it makes you think. what more can you ask for in a book?!"
107,4,great!,"i had to read this for my college english class. i'm not much of a reader of the classics, but i was surprised by how much i like this book. an incredible use of satire and wit.although, i will say, i know i wouldn't have gotten as much out of it if it wasn't for the class i was taking. i still found the story and voltaire's implications quite enjoyable."
108,5,Surpringly not boring!,"When I started this very short book, I expected it to be a drone-fest from the 1700s. However I was pleasantly surprised to find the story gripping, the satire comical and devious, and my time well spent. I even read sections of the book to younger siblings of ages 10 and 6, and they paid attention with great detail. I would highly recommend this book as a classic for a reason."
109,4,IT SURE BEATS CRIME AND PUNISHMENT!!,"I just finished reading Candide for an Advanced Placement Senior English class, and suprisingly, I actually enjoyed it. Having toiled through many long, hard books troughout the year, this hilarious, SHORT, easy-to-read book was a relief! I loved the satire, and how Voltaire is constantly poking fun at people and their ideas--at times, I laughed out loud at the way he describes things. Although it is not the best book I've ever read, I definitely recommend it."
110,5,Should Be Required Reading,"I have owned this book for quite awhile but put off reading it, fearing that it would be dull and scholarly. I was in for a wonderful surprise. His philosophy makes a lot of sense and he puts it forth in a simple story accessible to almost everyone. Many, many times I laughed out loud. It was fun as well as enlightening. The term ""sixes and sevens"" was used; what is the etymology of that expression? The violence is expressed in an absurd way, though we know awful things did and do happen."
111,2,Heavy Handed,"Candide may have been something in its day, but as a modern reader only marginally versed/interested in 18th century France, I found reading it to be rather dull. (Before I get comments about how I'm stupid, I would like to point out that although I sometimes like to read classics for fun, my career and focus has always been in the sciences)Like other satires I've read, Candide seemed heavy-handed and flat. The philosophy of optimism is silly! Absurd things happen! Cue another character who only stands for symbols and has no real personality!This is why I don't read satire very often.I gave this two stars rather than one because I recognize that one may potentially get a chuckle out of the some of the ridiculous situations, and that someone more well acquainted with the particular philosophies may find Voltaire's criticism more entertaining. And it only took one day to read, which I suppose is a mark in its favor as well."
112,3,a decent book but somewhat overrated.,"i should start by saying that i like voltaire very much but can't understand how this work has come to overshadow his ""alphabet of wit"". if u can get a hold of this little book it will be well worth your time. far more amusing and intelligible than candide. voltaire could be a very funny man and there really wasn't a lot of humour in candide. i thought candide was a bit boring at times. also, he did NOT demolish the argument that this is the best of all possible worlds. with matter there are limitaions and the arguments are complex. this book deals with none of them. but i still adore voltaire."
113,3,Overrated,"This book was moderately entertaining from a fictional standpoint. However, maybe I am shallow, but I did not see the philosophical genius which is frequently exalted in this work. I felt the conclusion was a great let down after all of the events that led up to it. Perhaps if it is viewed through a lense relevant to the time it is written it is more profound."
114,5,A Fairy Tale for the Thinkers,"Everyone will like this story for different reasons. It's easily read, and one can then toss out the phrase ""I, frequent reader of Voltaire, think..."". Alternatively, one can read it AND think about it. How strikingly funny it is. How incredibly relevant it remains to this day. How possible it is to challenge blind optimism and yet not wallow in complete despair and self-pity. Above all, I found it to be a very accessible work of philosophy. Ahem. I mean, ""I, frequent reader of Voltaire, think it is a rather accessible work of philosophy..."""
115,4,CANDIDE,"I picked this book up at the bookshop near Ground Zero. And to my suprise it was not a heavy story that caused one anguish to read it. I thought the story was told in a quick straight forward way that was both fun and educational. I agree if one were to really take this book and ponder over the morals Voltaire tries to preach, then the book wouldn't have been as entertaining to me. Nice and lite read. I recommend it to anyone over the age of 18.I think I know why this book was not taught in many schools, it does have a hint of anti-Semitism."
116,2,Needs to be written in new style english,"I disliked the book very strongly. If it was in new style english and brought out the meanings in plain words it would have been so much better.It took me reading somethings 4 or 5 times to understand its real meaning, and sometimes after that it still didn't make sense to me. I did find it weird how the story from way back at that time is really close to a lot of stories on the Jerry Springer show.To end my review you would like it if you were into old english literature, but thats just not for me."
117,2,Meh...,"Well, this had been on my list for some time. Maybe I expected too much? I think it was probably just a bit above my taste, perhaps. I get that it is satire... I get what is being satirized... Maybe I was not in the right frame of mind and one day I will reread it.It is short and that is easily done."
118,2,Publisher?,"I found the book itself to be interesting and entertaining, however I attempted to write a paper about it for school, but there is no publisher information or translator. I do not suggest this version of the book for students planning to use it in papers."
119,4,Very cool.....,"This is my first attempt at Classic Literature, and I have to say that this one was very interesting, very well thought out, and dowright good. I loved the descriptions, the overall story. It gave me a new appreciation for literature. Short read, finished in a day and a half.Christopher Berry"
120,4,Oh What a FAntastic Tale,"This is a hilarious romp through the 18th century world that Voltaire knew. This book provided him to make fun of the intellectuals of the day (cannibals who only eat Jesuits) the politics of Europe and the social mores of the elite. His characters include the noble Candide who combines his good heart with his reliance of Gilgamesh like helpers in order to succeed. His hero worship for Dr. Pangloss, the Rasputin like philosopher (and later Martin) bailed him out of some situations but perhaps more importantly his lesser, Cacambo saved his life. All of the fantastic adventures that Candide experienced were all designed to reunite him with his true love Cunegonde.Many years later, Upton Sinclair wrote a ""Candide"" like, utopian socialist fantasy novel, Metropolis that I was reminded of while reading this novel."
121,5,a good book,this book was pretty good. it was kind of weird but good. i thought that it wasnt a satire but my lit teacher said that it was so you have to interpret it as one. if you dont then it makes it look like any regular book that you would read.
122,5,Truly a Beautiful Thing...,"I saw the show in Chicago and it was brilliant! The story is so honest and heart-felt. Harvey did a magnificent job of not turning the show into a cliched ""gay"" play."
123,3,"Not horrendous, but not the most memorable","Pros:a) A film with decent to interesting background scenesb) Creative monstersc) Occasionally high frame rate in action sequencesCons:a) Disjointed story telling going from hunting the infected to hunting the possessed with no connectionb) A failure to connect to flat charactersc) Besides the final battle, not enough memorable visuals unfold beforehand.In summary if you like the works of Yoshiaki Kawajiri then be sure not to miss this film which adds to the darker side of his anime aesthetic. Though this film is very sub-par to Wicked City it does have its momments and should be given the honor of a rental."
124,3,more like a strong 3.5 stars,"Komada and Koshigaya are biologist battling with humans that are infected with a virus that turns them into demons.One cool twist is Komada is infected with the virus buts seems to be able to fight the virus off just enough to keep his human emotions intact when he sometimes transforms into a demon himself,this helps Koshigaya alot sence his just a scientist battling demons.Overall it was a pretty good idea with a simple plot.The picture quality was o.k. and the dolby 5.1 sounded more like pro logic 2.0Go ahead pick this up you won't be dissapointed, but do notice the anime only last 60 min."
125,1,Disappointing.,"Regardless of what I have read here, I think this movie is not on the same technical or artistic merit as Akira or Ghost in the shell are. The graphic art is very poor, the story telling is also very badly done. Any one that is not a japanimation fan but does like pictures like the above mention, will find it as disappointing as I have. I do not recommend this title. don't waste your money ."
126,5,Great Book!,I love this book! I am a professional graphic designer that does not know how to write any JavaScript. I just wanted to be able to create more dynamic pdf files. The author did a great job explaining the JavaScript used in this book in a way that non programmers can grasp!Mr. Deubert was also very gracious in helping me customize one of the scripts in his book to work for a specific project I had. He stands behind his product!I recommend this to anyone that is a non programmer looking to learn how to use JavaScript with Acrobat.
127,5,EXCELLENT!,"Purchased this book knowing full well it was outdated, but for a beginner in PDF forms this was and is and excellent purchase. Came through quickly and in Excellent condition. I would recommend this book to anybody who is starting out creating and making forms more user friendly. Great Job, can't wait till the next book gets released... please put it on Kindle, Nook and iPad versions as well as Print."
128,3,Quality control has a lot to be desired,"I had expected a better product. My $30 Delta is a superior product. I don't know if the problem is quality control or poor design. The shower head appears solid. The hose is good. The shower spray is the part I am unhappy about. The rubber extrusions that form the large spray pattern are not uniform, resulting in a wide and non-uniform spray. A couple of the shower mini-streams come out at an extreme angle...making for an unsatisfactory shower experience. Also, when you turn the adjustment for different spray patterns, the adjusting knob does not line up with the matching spray. It's off by a half-adjustment. No big deal, but it suggests poor quality control to me. I'm sorry I bought this product."
129,5,Portals to Freedom,"Of all the books I have purchased lately this is one of the few that I read completely in a timely way. I purchased 3 copies, one of which I sent to my sister, one I have to give to someone?? whenever the spirit moves me. I love to buy from Amazon because the price is usually decent and it saves an old person lots of running around."
130,3,Hoping for a bit more.,"Although this is a good book with valuable information, I think it is a bit vague and short. A good idea is to get 3 different books on their respective topics. Nessus and snort have nothing to do with eachother and snort is more powerful than Ethereal. Its work buying if you have the money and has some decent tips and tricks."
131,3,Not for newbies,"Very in-depth, however, not for someone who is just starting out on Snort, Nessus, or Ethereal. New to Snort, Nessus, or Ethereal - Buy something else. Expert on Snort, Nessus, or Ethereal already? - good book."
132,5,I love it,"What can you say about a sweatshirt? It great, I've been wearing it for years now. I love it."
133,4,Big Band Sound,"The illustrations in this book were first to catch my attention. Garden-lovers will feel right at home in these pages. But the story is also beautiful...about a child who has a goal and finds creative ways to achieve it. We found this book in the public library, but we need one to keep at home!"
134,3,Very thin material and very small,The size Medium only fits a woman's hand and the material is really thin which pills and gets destroyed by velcro. This is a good little support glove for what it is without a full plastic back splint system.
135,3,Disappointed,"I guess I'm probably just a fan of George's smooth later 50s & 60s sound, I think that material is just phenomenal. As for this box set: it includes a very informative booklet, but the sound quality is dull, not crisp at all and it just turned me off enough that I stuck my copy on eBay.It was like listening to an AM radio broadcast & as excited as I was to get this, I didn't add it to my collection for long simply because of the sound quality, certainly not the performance. If you can get past this fact, it is a very good compilation of his early material (as early as 1939)."
136,5,Delightful!,"This is a wonderful read. It makes a great bedtime story and it is also beautiful (the wood carvings) and inspiring. This is good for people tired of reading what is wrong with the environment. The Man Who Planted Trees is kind of like a sophisticated Lorax book. Anyway, buy this book and enjoy it!"
137,5,"Beautiful illustration, beautiful story","Jean Jiono's meandering myth works at so many levels I have no idea where to start. The parable touches on personal dedication, patience, the chance of ecological redemption, and ironies introduced when the loner comes to the authorities' attention. The pace seems Zen-like, even monastic, as the speaker touches The Man's life at intervals of years.McCurdy's woodcuts complement the story perfectly, with gently elegant renderings of some selected moments from it. The images' black and white simplicity reinforces the simple life of The Man and the understated character of the writing.But, despite the words and images coming across in such a low-key way, I found the story deeply moving. It inspires me, too -- but inspires me to what? I really couldn't say, but I'm not sure I need to.-- wiredweird"
138,3,"Tiny Book, Be Aware of This Before Buying","I was shocked when I received my book yesterday in the mail. It's only 3""x4"". I can't believe I paid over $7 for this tiny thing. The story may be good, but the heading of the item should have noted that it was this small. That's too much money for a tiny paperback. If I had known this before purchasing, I never would have ordered it.I haven't read it yet, it was supposed to be a gift, but I'm embarrassed now to give it to someone as a birthday gift because it's so little (so it looks cheap).I'll follow up with a reading review after I'm done with it. I ordered it because I read the reviews about the story and I thought it would be a nice gift for my 11 yr old granddaughter, whom I'm always pushing to read. I'm going to have to get her something else now though, this really inconveniences me. From the reviews of the story, it looks like a good read.Shipping time & adequate packing was perfect."
139,5,Offering hope in a troubled world,"This is a delightful allegory, offering hope to change the world by the persistence of one man, working one day at a time, over many years. Written after the ravages of World War I, this story tells the tree planter in all of us that the seeds of one person's dreams will change the lives of thousands.The wood block prints are an added bonus. I've given this book to sons, to foresters, and to those who need hope in troubled times."
140,1,Great story,"This story was meant to be Jean Giono's gift to the world, but the publishers took over to make money. There are certain places on the web where you can still access this wonderful story the way in which the author intended."
141,4,A little book to read and re-read,"Jean Giono's inspiring little book ""The Man Who Planted Trees"" explores the contrast between earth husbandry and war-mongering, succeeding on nearly every level. The true power in the work is in it's simplicity, mirrored in Michael McCurdy's wonderfully detailed black-and-white wood engravings which illustrate the work.In a well-written afterword, Norma Goodrich explores Giono's linkage of literature as a balm for hopelessness with a dream to reforest the earth (which may sound like a bit of a stretch, and requires a descent to humanistic sappiness, alas).This book should appeal to readers of all ages."
142,1,Customer Beware!,"Purchasers should be aware that this book is a miniature and its approximate size is 3 1/2"" x 3 1/2""."
143,1,Cheap,"These balls are not hard; it's cheap plastic one with lots of air in it, which makes it squish.. if you are looking to massage you feet by applying any amount of pressure, don't get this. I tried it for about 3 minutes and one of them popped and is not useless. time to return it"
144,2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for music to exercise with and this CD did not meet my needs, I am not sure who would like this."
145,2,An interesting prospect,"A small band of children in Florida are trying to scrape up a living in a burnt out dead town. A plaugue (nuclear holocaust, diesease....whatever) killed the adults on the planet which indirectly lead to the death of nearly all the children as well. These 7 children (the oldest being 17) are fighting to make a living when a strange teenager (around 15) appears on the doorstep.He calls himself ""the Anchorman"" and intices the children into a wild journey to find a man named ""President"" (kinda corny dontcha think?). The journey is laced with strange happenings and interesting appearences but has a killer cliffhanger at the end.This book could have been very good, but was far too wordy. It spent far too much time trying to make stories, rather than developing the characters and the plot. On the hole, a rather disappointing start to a series. This review is by a 15 year old avid reader........who is definitely not impressed."
146,2,The Kindling needed more sparks,"This is the story of a group of children left to survive on their own after a virus (hence the series title ""fire-us"" - which is virus in baby-speak)has killed most of the human population.Some parts of the story are interesting. One of the older kids, Hunter, spends a great deal of time searching for food in old stores and houses. The dialogue between the kids, however, is tedious and boring. It is also very difficult to believe that children would end up acting the way the main characters do in this story.If you want to read really good survival stories, then try reading Philbrick's Last Book in the Universe or Robert Swindells' Brother in the Land."
147,4,Book Was Good,This book was amazing The way the author made it sad and very exciting. The book made me want to read even more. But why were the adults the only ones to die instead of the kids. The book could've been better and more sad and exciting.
148,5,Gripping and Inspired,"As an adult who loves children's fantasy and survival novels, this was a real page-turner. It sounds morbid to say I 'enjoyed' the book, but I don't think that was the author's intent. I felt a gloom and sense of foreboding dread the entire time. It's gritty, real, and very immersing, even heartbreaking at times to consider the story of these kids and how they would grow and develop without adults in the world. It was reminiscent of Lord of the Flies and Red Dawn, with a little bit of Stephen King's 'The Stand' thrown in for good measure, but it wasn't derivative of any of these.I must also say that the style of writing was very different and engaging - these two authors have a great voice, style, and the prose flows right along - impressive without being obtrusive. I'm very excited about reading the rest of the series."
149,3,It was a good book,"The Kindling took place in the year 2007. The world has been wiped out.[just the adults]from a deadly pluge. There was no electricity, no civilataion only kids. Seven children survide the dieses and Know live in a small town in Florida. They all changed their names to mommy,hunter,Teacher,Action figure,teddy bear,baby and dolly. These kids lost their parents and now are living alone. I gave this book three stars because u liked the inmagination of Jennifer Armstrong had to put in to this book the Kindling. things I didn't like about her book I also didn't lie how it went back in forth between the characters.i also liked Jennifer Armstrongs great way of explaining the characters fellings.This boo9k is the first of its trilogy of FIRE-US."
150,5,Savage seamless paper,"This is an off white color. More of a vanilla than a white. Ive used it a few times though, and like the color . The shipping tube is a great storage tube when not in use."
151,4,"Richardson great as Holmes, but...","the DVD is grainy, and the story does deviate from the text somewhat. The packaging is nicer than the one for the Richardson ""Hound of the Baskervilles,"" but I would still say that the Granada version with Jeremy Brett is the better of the two."
152,2,"If you've read one, you've read 'em all......","I suspect if you're a Garwood fan you will enjoy this novel. To me, her novels are all too similar. With Ransom, she takes the reader yet again into the highlands with a bit of mystery, adventure, clan-loyalty, and romance. Actually, the romance aspect is debatable b/c attraction is NOT romance as far as I'm concerned.Garwood's characters are all the same, she merely changes their names in each of her books. I'm not saying they are dislikable, just redundant. Other reviewers boast this is Garwood's best highlander romance; if this is true, I am not interested in reading any others. It wasn't awful, it was just the same old stuff."
153,2,Why does everyone like this book?,"I have always liked Julie Garwood (until the Roses). But this book is pretty lame. It has echoes of her past style, but is vastly inferior. The first few chapters were so confusing that I checked to see if pages were missing from my book. I tried hard to like it, but how many times can you read: Brodick; Yes Judith; Gillian; Yes Brodick; Ian; Yes Ramsey; Did Ms Garwood need some filler? No one talks that way. I was quite disappointed, but read it anyway."
154,1,...jusr miserable,"This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."
155,2,Too many characters,"I read through the first 50 pages of this book, and I couldnt keep up with all the characters. I Did not read the first book ""The Secret"", and maybe it would have been easier to keep up with if I had. Either way, it was just way too confusing."
156,1,dreadful...,"possibly the worst book I have ever read...her history is not good-being English the term ""Pa will paddle my backside"" is not really something that a modern English person would say let alone someone supposedly born in the reign of King Richard. It just grated so badly that the rest of it left me cold, I love historical romances/fiction but please make some effort to get the time period even remotely correct!"
157,1,"Annette, CA","My aunt persuaded me to read this book. I am not a big fan of Romance but I gave it a try. Did this book change my mind about this geanre? No, not really. The characters seem very undeveloped - the author told us upfront what they thought and felt rather than letting them convey it through their actions. Brodick is very rude and primitive. All that comes to mind is that he talks ""gruffly"" - that word was used 98 times to describe him (and that is only where I bothered to count). As for poor Gillian, she is just too irritating even to talk about. To wrap it all up -- NOT an interesting read. (Sorry Gulie Garwood..)"
158,4,Refreshing,"This was the first book by Garwood that I have ever read. She has the most intriguing way of ending almost every chapter with one liners that compels the reader to read on. In chapter 24 she carries the reader on an emotional climax only to have it come racing back to reality with one devastating line.I will definitely have to read more of her works, and would highly recommend her."
159,5,Julie Garwoods best book yet!,I really loved this book. When I read the Secret I thought then that the characters of Brodrick and Ramsey would be great for another book. I'm so glad she used them for this one. Ransom had such a great story with wonderful heroes and villans I loved to hate.
160,5,ANOTHER CAN'T-PUT-DOWN BOOK,"ONCE AGAIN JULIE GARWOOD HAS WRITTEN A BOOK WHERE I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. ALL I WANT TO DO IS READ, READ, READ. I FEEL THAT I AM BEING TAKEN BACK IN TIME AND THAT I AM ACTUALLY A PART OF THE STORY, A THIRD PARTY, OF COURSE. RANSOM WAS A FUN-LOVING BOOK WITH OLD CHARACTERS RETURNED FROM THE SECRET, AND THEY HAVE A MAJOR ROLE, NOT JUST A FLY-BY- NIGHT MENTION."
161,3,Character Crossing,"Many points for the story, but take away for dropping too many characters from other books.I am a Garwood fan, but some characters are just to large to drop in and out as minor characters."
162,5,Best Book Ever!,"The Ransom book by Julie Garwood is truely riviting and the characters come to life. I have this book in paper as well as on Kendal book. this is one of my favorite books by far. I have read this Ransom about 5 times now from cover to cover. Everytime i read it i capture the true essense of Characters. I would love to see the younger generation in the books to come spring to life. I cannot seem to get enough of Julie's, characters; Ian, Brodrick, Ramsey Patrick and their wives, I would love to see the story unfold more.Thank you for your stories they are truley inspirational! A devoted Fan!"
163,4,Liked,I liked this book. The characters are very enjoyable and the plot was interesting. It was a little predictable though...
164,2,Tara,"Pleasant reading material, but not in the same league as some of the other Julie Garwood books I have read. A good tale, but not much excitement."
165,5,I loved this book!,I have to say that I have read all of Ms. Garwood's books and by far this one is my favorite. I have read it over several times and still love it each and every time!
166,5,FINALLY!,"I must admit, it's been a while since Ms. Garwood has written a really and truly good story. The characters were well-developed and the plot just complicated enough so as not to be predictably boring. She was my first and, still is, my favorite romance author. This one I just COULD NOT put down! I finished it in a day! for anyone who loves historicals, this one is definitely a must read! :)"
167,4,Garwood does it again!,"This is another great book by Garwood. I will admit, though, the beginning was kind of confusing with too many characters all at once. But, if you stick with it, all falls into place and it turns into another great read like all of her others. I'm a fan."
168,1,on the edge of your seat,"Gillian claimed to be Brodick's bride to spark his curiousity. He tricked her into marriage to claim her heart. What Brodick didn't know was that in order to claim her heart, he had to give her his. He had to show her he cared.This is a truly heartstopping romance, one that I found I couldn't put down. It's about the brave, stubborn young Gillian who is the only key to finding King John's beloved jeweled box, and the only key to the toughest Hilander Lord, Brodick Sinclair's heart"
169,5,Wonderful,"I love Julie Garwood's historical romance novels, especially the ones that have to do with the Highlands. Reading this book was like catching up with old friends from the book The Secret. If you haven't read The Secret you should read that first then read Ransom so that you will be familiar with the characters. You will fall in love with Brodick and his gruff nature but you will see that he is just a pussycat, I just wish that Ramsey and Bridgid's story was a bit more longer. Either way I would definitely recommend this book to read."
170,5,"Great characters, great book !!!","I am a huge fan of Julie Garwood. I have read every single book of hers. But Ransom is deffinitely my favourite. Why I loved the book? First of all, the heroine is not a weak, silly girl. She is strong and the way she behaves and holds herself when she is in pain was amazing. Second, I can feel the love between Brodick and Gillian every time I read the book (and I assure you, I have read this book for 4 times already). Besides, every single dialog means something and I never got bored while I was reading the book. The third thing is deffinitely this is not only plain romance between 2 people but also there are intrigues and real conflicts pulling the reader in. There are always something happening through the book so you never get bored. I would like to say a little about why I didnt like the book but there is not even one reason!!! 100% loved it !!!"
171,5,It does not disappoint!,"I loved this story!!! If you are like me and you reread all her stories this will be added. It did not lack or miss anything. I came away from this book with a smile on my face. ""Come the Spring"" and ""The Wedding"" just seemed to lack the depth that I've come to expect from Julie Garwood and I was hoping and praying to see the old Julie back in evidence. It was wonderful. Now I would like to read all about Nicholas and Clare's story from ""Saving Grace""."
172,2,I don't get it,"Seriously, 200+ thought this book deserved five stars? This was my first Julie Garwood book and will be my last. I enjoy dialogue between characters, but seriously-- 10 pages of dialogue between the heroine and a six-year-old? The characters were superficial and the amount of dialogue was way overkill. If they hadn't told me the book was set in Scotland and they didn't frequently throw in the word ""Laird"" I would have had no idea. There was no culture, no historical authenticity... I agree with another review that said it read like someone's very first novel, and a bad one. I ventured outside of my normal genre of historical fiction and this is what I got. I'm only giving it two stars because it wasn't HORRIBLE, but definitely cliche and boring."
173,1,Ugh!@ I was bored!!!,"I haven't read a Julie Garwood in 10 - 20 years. I did enjoy some; Lion's Lady, The Bride, and even ""The Secret."" But, nothing has changed with her historical novels. Still flaky and almost child-like heroines. This was a long and ridicules story. Sorry Julie, I have out grown your historical novels. I still think she is a talented writer, her contemporary novels are not that bad. Sorry . ):"
174,1,Pages out of order,"The kindle version has a few pages out of order, which is incredibly frustrating. Luckily I have the print version and could figure out what was going on. I informed Amazon about it but don't buy the digital version until it's fixed."
175,5,An Absolute Joy!,"To Ms. Garwood: I own every book you have ever written and was absolutely delighted to find some of my most favorite characters in this book. This book is so filled with love and laughter that I *had* to read it from cover to cover, and was sad to finally close the book on such vivid personalities. Should you be inclined to allow any of the other characters fall in love in a third book, I would be thrilled!"
176,5,"And, A Note To Julie Garwood","I'm one of those people who says she wouldn't be caught dead with a romance novel. Imagine my surprise when a friend loaned this to me and told me it was a mystery, which she knows I love and I finally relized it was a romance! Julie Garwood lovingly developes her characters; she interests, involves and excties this reader and tells me a wonderful story. I ran right out and bought the ""prequel"" ""The Secret"" wherein we meet the Maitland clan and many of ""Ransom's"" characters. My note to Ms Garwood is, 'Please, please', take us home with Gillian Buchannan to the places and people she has not met, and keep us in touch with the Sinclairs and the Maitlands. A trilolgy would be such a joy!!"
177,4,Great but still a bit lacking...,"I'll skip the synopsis since many of the reviews have already thoughtfully provided them. :)After reading The Secret, I knew I just had to pick up its sequel. Brodick was such an interesting character. I feel as though this book dulled Brodick's personality. Throughout the book, I kept hoping that Julie Garwood would show more facets of Brodick's character. Also, I was hoping that she would provide more details about Ramsey and how he found love. The brief glimpses you see of Ramsey and Bridgit are the same scene on repeat. It'd be better if she took out Ramsey's story or make another novel out of it. It would be much more appealing. I'm not saying that this isn't a great love story. It just lacks some of the finer points that have been in her other novels."
178,4,A Dashing Adventure Across the Highlands!,"Now, when most people think of Historical Romances, they wouldn't be necessarily wrong if they lumped it all into the Harlequin Romance genre. But a well-written Historical Romance or HR for future reference, can be a beautiful thing! I never read an HR for the sexual content, as is the first comment I get when I tell them I'm reading this genre. The sexual content is least of what interests me, if at all! A well written HR explores much more! It is usually a study in period norms which includes dress, habits, transport, architecture, literature, art, lifestyle, fashions, speech, vocabulary, historical facts and characters loosely or not so loosely based in fiction, etc.!!!Julie Garwood captures these features in her characters with Ransom! She has a truly refreshing take on the dashing knight and the princess-in-need-of-rescue theme! ...www.ramblingsofbookworms.blogspot.com"
179,2,Missing Text,"I have a weakness for Julie Garwood books, and repurchased this book in Kindle format after buying the original version many years ago. While there are a few formatting errors, there is also a gap in content starting at location 5869. It appears there are several pages missing. Extremely annoying -- will be returning this book."
180,4,Charming,"I think my favorite parts of this story involve how the different clans had to work together, here. I feel like we never got to see the fabled Buchanan Spartans, though, which was a bummer for me.Sweet story with one and a half heroines and one and a half heroes. Couple of surprises and highlanders who were, predictably, clueless about their feelings.I think these stories have been charming but I perhaps need to space my reading of them so that they don't feel so similar.Still, a good story, involving and fun and one that leaves you with the ""Awww...."" and ""Finally!"" there at the end. :)"
181,3,Good but not the best,"This sequel to 'The Secret' is pretty good but I liked 'The Secret' better than this one. 'Ransom' is a fast read but ends a bit abruptly. The author could have developed Ramsey's romance in a separate novel. That would have justified his charming personality.A new reader would find this novel neat but if you have read her earlier novels like Saving Grace and The Secret, this doesn't stand a good chance."
182,3,cheekyface,"I am a great fan of Julie Garwood and like all her other books-EXCEPT THIS ONE! This book made me really ANGRY.The heroine Gillian did not have any backbone at all. How could she not know that she was getting married, for God's sake????And the hero Brodick did push her around a lot, did not value her opinions. Did not even ask her if she wants to marry him! Now that is stretching things a little too far.But to be fair, the plot of the book was really good. And this book did not stop me from reading Garwood's other books."
183,4,"not one of her best, but still good!","I have always loved Julie Garwood's books and am ALWAYS waiting for her to come out with something new. Ransom is not one of her best books, but it was still good. She is such an exceptional writer that it seems hard for her top what she's already done. The characters Brodick and Gillian seemed to be missing something. They just didn't seem like they were as well suited for each other as some of the characters from her other novels. I was actually more interested in Ramsey and Gillian and really think they deserved their own book. That would be a GREAT story, I think."
184,5,"Her best so far, Ms Garwood never dissapoints us.","It was wonderful, I could hardly wait to get home and read it. I was thrilled to find out what happend with Judith and Frances Catherine. Ms Garwood is my favorite author. This was truly one of Ms. Garwoods finest books."
185,4,Very Enthralling,"This was actually two romances in one--although the Gillian-Brodick romance takes center stage, and the Bridgid-Ramsey relationship develops in the margins. But you won't mind.Like the other reader who would have liked a little more history, I too would have liked a little more detail from the period. The novel's real strength is that it really moves along...you really feel like you are on an adventure with these characters. While with some novels you can see a predictable conclusion on the horizon, this one really keeps you guessing. I really couldn't guess how things were going to end. What fun!The characters are also very likable--Brodick is a man who wins you over by his compassion and his rough edges.Overall, a very enjoyable read that I too found very hard to put down (I read well into the evening one night!)."
186,4,I loved the first half,"I was held completely enthralled through the first half of this book. i loved the setting and it's description. I loved the heroine and the 'wee lad' she took under her wing. My only problems with it were that, for me, there weren't enough love scenes, and they arrived too late in the story...and the fact the author decided to throw in another couple into the mix, without fully fleshing out their story. I think Ms. Garwood should have stuck to her main protagonists and left the other couple for another book"
187,4,Great Read,"Ramsay Sinclair and Brodick Buchanon, make a reappearance in this new novel as the heroes. Both now Lairds, they must discover who plots to harm Ramsay's young brother. In the process they meet two remarkable women who disrupt their lives and teach them about love. Fun to read, with a lot of action, adventure and ludicrous dialogue between these feisty women and their oh-so-stubborn suitors, this book keeps you turning the pages. However...Aside from the fact that all of the characters fall in love too quickly for me to keep track of, this book was a great read with the exception of the weak ending. Ms. Garwood, made the women appear both weak and weepy, when those words are a far cry from their indomitable characters. A better attempt could have been made to keep the characters true to form."
188,2,A Let Down To much like all of her others,"I was looking forward to reading another great book by Julie Garwood, what I got was a book that had flat characters and didn't make me feel anything the way her other books have. Maybe if I hadn't read her other books and hadn't expected so much of this new one I would have liked the book better. The bottom line is I am sick of all of her heriones getting lost and having no sense of direction. And if one more wrings her hands together I think I'll scream! Miss Garwood needs to start to give her heros and heriones new personalities and stop having them all share the same traits and act alike. The only reason I did not give it one star was because the story was there, but the characters were not."
189,5,Ransom,Good story wish it would continue into another story line. Love this book but where is the next one to follow
190,2,Kind of hard to believe,"This book was harder for me to get through than most. I found it a little plodding and contrived. The historical content and language were poor - I prefer to read historical novels that at least attempt to keep with the language and characteristics of the time. This one did not. I found Gillian to be a little weak in just succumbing to Brodick's wishes and getting caught or in trouble whenever she didn't. Some central characters, such as the little boys who were the initial start of some of the trouble and Gillian's sister Christen, were not dealt with to my satisfaction. It is almost like they were created, then forgotten and then brought back again just so they could be wrapped up.While I won't say this is a bad book, it was somewhat disappointing. Be prepared to suspend your belief and get through some plodding moments and you can manage to enjoy this book for the most part. I just didn't after a while."
191,1,Refunded! No text to speech option,Beware!!! No text to speech option. Amazon was wonderful and refunded the cost of the book. Amazon has great customer service. I have contacted the author and publisher to voice my option on this matter.
192,3,She wrote this in her sleep!,"I have every book Julie Garwood has ever written. I am puzzled, why sometimes (and this book is one) it appears she has lost her zest for writing; using the same format and wording from prior stories. Your price however, makes this a very good buy, within this novel you learn about old friends, from some of her other works. It is worth reading, but I wouldn't rush out and pay full price a second time."
193,5,Julie Garwood is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have read all of her books and I think she is a fantastic writer. Ransom is by far one of her BEST books. No body else can compare to her!!
194,5,Great Book!,RANSOM was wonderful. A compelling plot and characters that come to life. I laughed and then I cried and then I laughed again. Garwood is the best at weaving a touching story. I highly recommend this book.
195,4,"Lush setting, action story sets up romance","Gillian is summoned by the man who murdered her father when she was a child to determine the location of a stolen treasure. As she tries to find a long-lost sister who may have the treasure, Gillian turns to Scottish chieftain Brodick. As he tries to help her find the treasure and save her uncle, she unwittingly marries Brodick, who has decided he will simply take what he wants, a tradition of his people that does not sit well with English-born Gillian. His strength and bravery win her over, however, as the two take on all of England to clear her father's name and restore her family's legacy.This is a well-spun tale. Although the Highlanders are a little edgy and rough, and Gillian keeps changing from flimsy damsel in distress to fighting, serious-wound-enduring heroine, I liked the pair and their many cohorts. Not a believable story in many respects, but an entertaining one."
196,1,Hated this book ...,"If you've read anything else, don't get this book. The information in here is SO general that it could be applied to just about anything. The book lists quick explanations of what will happen, but no information on how to respond to what you'll experience. Additionally, there were frightening statements in this book letting me know the author was no expert on the subject of baby rearing. I was exasperated to read her thought that babies should usually be placed in the backseat of the car. I think that everyone knows that is the ONLY place to put a baby in the car. Though, I'm afraid unknowledgeable people will read this book and think it's ok to do such things as put a baby in the front seat of the car.If you've read ANYTHING else, you don't need this book. In fact, if you haven't read anything else, you still don't need this book. Don't waste your time or money."
197,3,Dj Kinda the same...,"I was sorta expecting a very creamy smooth trippy ride, but all I got was another ""standard"" Frenchy hip-hop comp. I loved the Dj Cam stuff, and Kid Loco is somewhat along the same lines, so it kinda bored me with it's predictability... You'll like it if you haven't heard enough French Hip(trip)Hop."
198,3,Not a DJ (and no kick!),"Kid Loco's fame is not based on his skills at the turntables (which he picked up barely two years ago) but at the production console. Hence, there is no amazing mixing skills in this latest volume on the excellent `DJ kicks' series (and the new Kid Loco pieces are very disappointing). The real virtue of this CD is the selection of down tempo tracks: from Underworld to Jazzanova, from Future pilot A. K. A. to Bloomington's very own Lisa Germano, from Jazz to post-rock experimentation, Kid Loco's set is a who's who of this electronica genera."
199,3,Kid Loco-Are You Crazy?,"Although Kid Loco has had several great 12"" singles and a few good remixes he was not the person to choose for the next in the DJ Kicks series. This cd offers a fair overview of the ever evolving nujazz/brokenbeat sound eminating from the British underground-sadly only skimming the surface. Although he does offer a few tasty musical morsels his journey does not lead far from the previous contribution that set an example in eclecticism by Theivery Corporation. Good buy if you are a casual beathead. If your tastes require a bit more than the average fare aim for the innovative sounds by the Jazznova/Compost records crew who steal the show on this collection and also top it on their own recent complilation Future Sounds Of Jazz Vol6."
200,4,sorta the same/sorta different than the other DJ kicks...,"I compare it to a cross between: Kruder & Dorfmeister vs. DJ Cam's mixed cd... has a lil' of that Theivery Corp. flavor too!It didn't surprise me much, but then again, it didn't put me to sleep either...."
201,3,Not your average Public Affairs Guy,"This book looks at a Zhensheng, a propaganda soldier who is rolled up into the Cultural Revolution. When I bought this I thought it was a look at how China used to military information, particularly command information, but this is not the case. It's still a good book and very well illustrated with some great photos but more of a footnote to the Cultural revolution than anything else."
202,3,"Technically Perfect, But Passionless","Although Kurt Masur has done a fine job elevating the New York Philharmonic back into the first rank of world renowned orchestras, it is far from obvious, judging from this lackluster recording. These Rimsky-Korsakov pieces are played with technical perfection, but lack the warmth or enthusiasm that I have heard in other Teldec-recorded New York Philharmonic performances, most notably those of the Brahms symphony cycle and Dvorak's 9th Symphony. Only the Capriccio Espagnol is a passionate performance, but it falls short of the definitive Philips recording of the Rotterdam Philharmonic under David Zinman's baton. As for Scheherazade, there are more compelling, definitive performances with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra conducted either by Andre Previn or Seiji Ozawa (both recorded by Philips) that are worth owning."
203,4,Heads up- more of a packet than an actual book,I agree that this is a valuable addition to the small library of books for working mothers. But a heads up-- this is more of a bound packet than a book. It has a photocopied-type cover and looks like it was printed on a standard laser printer with double spaced Times New Roman font. Publishers-- someone work with the author to get a shiny new updated version please!
204,5,Wonderful,That is the cutest baby on the cover that I've ever seen in my whole life. It's about time that a successful lawyer found a way to structure her career around her family!
205,3,Hoya 62mm (G SERIES) Circular Polarizer PL CIR Filter,"Great value for the money, it does what its supposed to. If you use a polarizer alot in your photography get a high end Hoya polarizer."
206,2,A lead balloon,"As a child we lived in the Yakima Valley. Some summer afternoons my father would take me with him to buy vegetables from a Japanese farmer. My father, normally outgoing, was reserved and deferrential. Dad explained that the farmer before the war had been a successful engineer, but had lost everything when he was forced to go to ""the camp"" - a tragedy and great waste. I've been haunted by that guiet farmer ever since, so it was with enthusiasm that I began Stubborn Twig, the story of a Japanese family's American experience.Stubborn Twig is well researched and chock full of details about the Yasui family. Reading their story should be compelling. It's not. It's repetitious, tedious and a slow, difficult read. The last 50 pages, the third generation, is a mix of biography and sociologist psycho babble. So why read Stubborn Twig? Because it's an important story, an American story that has much to teach us, and one that shouldn't be forgotten."
207,3,disappointed,"Anticipated this accounting of the Japanese in America at that time---had been touched by this treatment of them as I lived in Southern California at that time---preteen--- and experienced air raid sirens and search lights---as well as losing my best friend to a concentration camp.The book is definitely an historical accounting of the affect on one family---but I found it overly discriptive in a repetitive style and lacking those stories---even little glimpses of those who did not own stores, or orchards or went on to higher education. Guess that is what I hoped it would be. My book club is discussing it tomorrow night at my home and several have echoed my thoughts---should be an interesting discussion."
208,1,Not very readable inspite of interesting subject,The subject matter is very interesting and the research was obviously thorough but reading it is another matter. I am afraid I just couldn't keep making myself plow through it. It surprises me that this was the Oregon Reads selection. You would have to be a truly determined reader already to get through the endless detail and absence of warmth or color in the writing.
209,4,Great book on why fluctuations are so high,Enlightening book on why even though you are a winner in the long run your short term fluctuations can be so large. Great section on bankroll requirements.
210,3,Thought Provoking and Annoaying,"While reading this book it forces you to think, which is excellent. However I found myself annoayed at some of Mason's comments as alot of what he says is semi-controversial and he seems to try to make everything over controversial, more so than it has to be."
211,2,I'm not sure what I was expecting...but not THIS!,"Unrelated stock footage, annoying repetitive sound effects galore, filler, inane sensationalized commentary, and more filler...if that floats your boat then give this ridiculous excuse for a documentary video a whirl, otherwise, avoid it like the plague."
212,2,"Interesting Plot, Plodding Execution","This wasn't worth reading, sadly. The plot was pretty well thought out, but the dialogue and characters were really underdeveloped."
213,4,"A fast paced, inventive, magical book","The story of young Christopher Chant and how he grows in to both his magic and his inheritance. To Christopher the landscape beyond his bedroom which leads to multiple worlds seems normal. It takes time for adults to realise he can access these worlds, and longer still for Christopher to understand the barriers to his own magic and the full extent of his powers. This book is conceptually vast, yet is also a fast paced adventure/mystery/fantasy story. I greatly enjoyed this book, which I read in one sitting, and look forward to reading the rest of the series."
214,5,This Book Rules,"If you are into fantasy, adventure, humor, or all of the above, you have to read The Lives of Christopher Chant. I own a copy of it and would highly reccomend it to everyone. If you have read this book and enjoyed it, you should also read Witch Week, Charmed Life, The Magicians of Caprona, and everything else written by Diana Wynne Jones."
215,1,seriously?,I have just about every workout there is and like a challenge. The only workout I got with this video is from pushing the fast forward button because she puts a 2 to 3 minute break between every set. There are 3 workouts and each workout is only about 8 minutes if you leave out the breaks. PLEASE do not waste your money Please. I am sending this back. I have never ever done such a bad workout. It is really ridiculous that this ever got released.
216,1,Horrible,"This DVD is a waste of money. I brought this DVD based on the 5 STARS reviews; the reviewers must be Lisa's friends and associates. There are no instructions for variations of levels. The DVD says so many reps for beginners, intermediate, and advance; but, there are no cues as to when and what levels should be doing what. There is no consideration for a learning curve or alternate ways of doing certain routines. There are way too many breaks for such a short workout routine. I purchases this DVD for an intense workout at home when I am unable to go to the gym; will have to invest in another Kettlebell workout. Lisa is making hand over fist on this DVD at the buyers expense."
217,1,Not at all what I expected,"This workout is a waste of time. I was excited when I saw all of the reviews before the dvd came out,nothing like what the postive reviews said. You barely break a sweat or get your heart rate up do to all of the pauses. The camera work is horrible. Very boring workout. I will no be buying the second video."
218,1,Save your time and money,"Kettlebell Bombshell with Lisa BalashI too was very disappointed with this DVD. I own quite a few workout DVDs as I like to exercise in the privacy of my own home. I've really gotten into kettle bells so I was excited when I read the reviews. It seems to give good instruction, but that's about it. The workouts aren't much of a workout. There are three minute rests between moves. I could drive to McDonald's and eat a cheeseburger before she starts on the next one. I guess you could hold the remote and keep fast-forwarding, but I have better things to do. This is the only workout DVD I've ever requested a refund for. The long, positive reviews must be from friends and business associates."
219,3,Great workout but boring,"I bought this DVD because of the reviews. I am new to Kettlebell workouts so I had to rely on the product reviews. I would agree that she does a great job at instructing on how to use the kettlebell correctly which is very important as injury can occur if done improperly. That being said, her tone is very monotone and her pace quite slow. She only does 5 reps which is beginner but she doesn't allow time to do more. I think she should do the max and if you need to stop and rest do so. The rest periods are way to long for me so I usually hop on the treadmill or do some ab crunches. It is a good workout but I think it needs to be bumped up in the excitable zone!"
220,4,Kettlebell WO is da' bomb!,"I have viewed a number of Kettlebell WO's, especially with female instructors. MOst are boring, too aerobic in nature and use light bells. This one is an instructional video at the beginning, emphasizing form always. I admit the rest periods can be longer if you're using a lighter bell weight but up that and you'll be thankful. She gives a rundown of beginning, intermediate and advanced with reps and rest. It's the way to start a program, no doubt."
221,3,Could she be anymore bland???,"I'm not thrilled with this DVD, it's more instructional than an actual workout, which is good. I am a kettelbell beginner, so the moves were explained very well, but I guess I expected something different. I should've bought The Firm's workout instead. Oh well..."
222,1,For beginners...,"I have been a exercise dvd junkie for years, Kettlebell dvds also. Although I like the exercises presented, I have some issues with her form. I know from personal experience, if you don't have your form correct, you can cause injury to other parts of your body as I did with my knees. Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise. I did pick up some good exercises but don't use this dvd as often as I would have liked. I will be sending it down the ""resell"" road."
223,2,Very disappointed,"The title's great - the cover is great - the instructions are mostly great ... There's no mention at any time of a warm up or a cool down - just grab your kettlebell and get after it I guess. The breaks between exercises? Weird, uninformative, and ... well, I know enough not to just sit down during that 30 - 60 - or 120 second break (yeah, up to 2 minutes of nothing but a timer), but since the breaks are never addressed in any manner whatsoever, I can see people doing the set and sitting down which wouldn't exactly be healthy. I really wanted to love it, but I think the shortcomings outweigh the good points, at least for me! I'm selling mine back to Amazon!"
224,4,Great Workout,"I was drawn to this DVD because of the title. It is a great workout, both cardio and strength. Lisa herself has communicated with me a few times to check in to see how I was doing and that impressed me a lot. Being new to exercising, I was not sure what to expect from this workout. Lisa's introduction on how to properly use the bells was great and is a workout in itself. I started out using a 10 lb. weight, even though she recommends 15-20 lbs. for women. The workouts are long enough so you feel it, but not too long as to interfere with your daily life. I am impatiently awaiting the second DVD from her. The only thing negative I can say is I wish I would have known what weights were recommended before purchasing. Overall, the exercised are great and really work different muscles than if you just used regular free weights. There are 3 workouts, upper, lower and circuit and all leave me feeling like I got a great workout."
225,1,Not worth the time or money,"I purchased this dvd hoping for a complete kettlebell workout. This is not that video. She has 4 different segments or ""workouts."" You would have to do all 4 just to feel that you had worked out with a kettlebell at all. The exercises are very short with very few repetitions and the breaks in between the exercises are way too long. The instructor states that she is really feeling it and her cardio was up. I was really bored and not feeling any sweat or cardio at all. Save your time and money and skip this kettlebell dvd."
226,3,Not that impressed,"I just got this in the mail yesterday and I was super excited thinking it was going to be amazing because of the previous posts. And overall, I guess its ""ok"" if you do all three workouts in a row, which I did.I have to agree with the people who complained about all the resting (between the few moves she does before another two minute rest period). You begin to feel like this is more of an instructional video before the real workout begins, which never happens."
227,1,"Not available yet,how can it be reviewed?",I don't understand how a DVD that hasn't been released yet has received so many reviews-all of them great. Has this DVD been released elsewhere?
228,2,"Gary Busey's son, and OH LOOK! a giant robot Hitler!","I wasn't expecting much when I rented this DVD at Blockbuster, and I was right not to.It takes place in Antarctica, but none of the actors look like it is cold outside. CGI is ridiculously cheesy (typical of a SyFy movie), far too many closeups of the actors' faces on the outside shots (clearly an attempt to conceal the fact they are on a movie set) and SPOILER ALERT! the worst ""robot Hitler"" CGI you can imagine.Nothing that happened in this movie surprised me one bit, and it is clear to see why Dominique Swain's and Jake Busey's careers circled the drain at least a decade ago.The only reason why I gave this film TWO stars instead of ONE is because the premise of the film attracted me: Nazis trying to restart the Third Reich from (insert place here).It's good for a few mindless laughs. Other than that, don't waste your time."
229,3,Fond Memories,"For those that remember ""They Saved Hitler's Brain!"", this movie is in many ways far superior. Good movie to watch if you just want to sit back and turn your brain to pudding, which I do from time to time. The movie that is far far worse than this one is ""Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies""."
230,1,"Terrible movie... I should have known better. I did know better. But, in the words of Crow T. Robot: ""I did it anyway.""","What to say about this movie? Terrible, wooden, hack acting. Bad/uneven lighting. Terrible CGI special effects. Hitler's over-acting head on a bad CGI robotic body. Nazi UFO. Hack job rip-off ofIron Sky.Frankly, the special features, for what they are, are actually more interesting than the movie itself. Not that they're super-interesting. But thee are features on pre-production, cast & location and one on the main production. Each one is all of about 5+ minutes long.And there's a commentary track.But those are about the only special features and hardly salvage this stink-burger.Overall, I'll rate this one a 'pass.' I might pick up Iron Sky at some point and see if it's any better, what-so-ever. One can hope. But the general premise is hokey to begin with, so I'm not holding out much hope on that one either. =o\"
231,2,How many different plot lines at the same time?,"Wow, truly how many plot lines can you put into a single movie? We start with the creation of the 4th Reich by escaping SS troops and scientists. Then we get zombie super troopers, forced abortion as a cure, a nazi spaceship, robo-hitler, etc... Don't pay more than $5 for this movie, that includes shipping. It had a few funny moments, but not many. The special effects weren't too bad, at least it wasn't a rocket on a string with a fire cracker in the tail. The actors were mostly supporting actors tossed into leading roles, or more like co-leading roles."
232,3,Pretty Fun,"Some of the CGI was a bit shabby, but overall i enjoyed it. It portrayed the horrors of their experiments on humans quite well and had some interesting ideas. I didn't get too bored watching the beginning as many have suggested. I do feel that given it's budget restraints it fell short of being better. I have definitely bought far worse and this is good enough to own and rewatch occasionally."
233,2,Not what I expected,"This DVD is a compilation of short excerpts from Christmas themed Veggietales videos. Some of the ""songs"" aren't even complete songs, just a portion of another video that has singing. A lot of cutting and pasting different scenes together to make a ""complete"" song. Not sure how 30 seconds of a musical number can be called a song. Portions seem to simply cut off in mid sentence. There are no traditional Christmas songs so its only a ""sing-a-long"" if your kids are familiar with the previously released Veggietales Christmas videos. My daughter loves the traditional Veggietales videos but lost interest in this within minutes. The very end of the DVD has 3 traditional Christmas songs that simply play the music and scroll the words across the screen karaoke style with a still background. Disappointed in this product from Veggietales."
234,5,Love VT!,"Love it! I have been watching VT since college and I'm 31 and still love them! My son LOVES watching the VT sing-a-longs in the car, and this one was perfect for the Christmas season!"
235,5,Beautifully illustrated,The gorgeous illustrations caught my eye and so I picked up the book for the first time. What a wonderful story. Kipling has a way of writing that just flows and makes reading the story out loud a pleasure just to hear the words.
236,5,Detailed guide to QFT,"The book's focus is on carefully explaining what quantum field theory is. Starting from classical field theories, ie. the harmonic chain, Greiner goes on to discuss 2nd quantization for spin 0, 1/2, and spin 1 fields. The results are then applied to derive the perturbation expansion for interacting fields. The last sections on quantization with path integrals is also well written, and contains more details than eg. Sakurai. Throughout, many (sometimes tedious, but) instructive examples are presented that lots of other authors just assume to be understood already."
237,1,Frustrating,"I am deeply disappointed and thoroughly frustrated with the perplexing and redundant complications of the book. It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic."
238,4,"Good series, bad doll","Well, if you are looking for a synopsis of the series, look at disk 1.This is probably one of my faovrite animes, and it's about time they brought it to the USA.Well now the important notes. This series DVDs as with most anime series DVDs are being released every other month. The doll that comes with the set has her feminine features far to over accentuated. I think mile long legs are great, but 2-3 mile long legs. Just get the regular DVD and save yourself a 10 spot."
239,1,"Nice idea, bad quality","I thought this product would really come in handy for camping. But after owning it for just a couple of days, I accidentally tipped it over and that was all it took. The lantern would not work. I sent away for a new bulb, but that did not fix the problem.This is a well thought out product that offers many handy features. Unfortunately, with typical Black and Decker quality, don't expect it to last long or to take even the slightest jarring. It could be a nice emergency item in case of a power blackout, but I would not recommend trying to take it anywhere on a trip because it is bound to break."
240,5,Great Utility Lantern,I bought this for a backup power for our company data center. It has come in handy a couple of times and it works great. We have not used the radio or the Power utlity much but all features work well enough. I am happy with the Black and Decker lantern and would recommend it.
241,4,real life ministry,"I purchased this cd when it first came out, largely because it contained some unsung ministry. I was not disappointed. The songs are good, but second to his live ministry. My favorite is the story he tells about picking up a hitchhiker who ends up a little ""ripe"" from not having bathed, and how easy it was to dismiss him, but how our Heavenly Father puts up and actually loves us through the foul stench of our sin. On this cd, Rich used humor and personal experiences to demonstrate God's love for a fallen people. Definitely worth hearing more than a few times."
242,1,Could have been better,"This is definitely not Murdock's best. Some of his books are excellent (eg., 7 Laws You must Honor to Have Uncommon Success) and some of them appear to be just pamphlets taken out of the Biblical text designed more to raise funds than to inspire with original insight into the scriptures. This book is typical of that type. One would be better off just reading the original source than reading Murdock's rehash in this one."
243,5,"A review of the book, unlike the author below........","1st let me say you're supposed to review the book, not give us a character assassination of Mike Murdock. Mike Murdock has an impeccable record (financial AND spiritual.) Moving on.....this book is filled with scriptures and insights as to how Jesus is a true leader and how you can follow His teachings. A great book for personal and professional development!"
244,5,"""HAIL the Ultimate Mentor!""","It takes a special person to point out the wondorous truths contained in the Bible which have been clamouring for the average person to incorporate them into their lives.Many Thanks and God's blessings to Mike Murdock. And, a wonderful experience awaits the next person to read this book."
245,1,Not Practicing What He Preaches...,"My mother, who worked for Mike Murdock for about a year, passed away July 28, 2005. When I sent him a letter informing him that my mother had died he began to barrage me with all kinds of sales literature thanking me for writing him, with never a word of condolence. I sent him a second ""Personal and confidential"" letter and more of the same followed. In the second letter I asked him to stop mailing me but his mailing onslaught continues. Would Jesus conduct himself in this way?Upon checking Murdock out it seems he makes a lot of questionable claims and according to the IRS he does not give all the aid and help to other people that he claims he does.My mother had a bunch of his books, including this one, and when I started to go through them as I awaited Murdock's responce, they seem to go over the same basic ""secrets"" over and over again, in different combinations. I cannot recommend following someone who will not practice what he preaches!"
246,2,Cat Claw Scratcher,"Could not get our cat to even think about using it. It just sits there taking up space until I decide to throw it out, or maybe find a neighbor that I could give it away to who has a kitten that could figure out what it's for and use it. But sadly, my older cat won't."
247,2,WHAT?,How can there be an influences record for Sarah McLachlan without any Joan Biaz. The woman her mother listened to all the time and made her want to become a singer?
248,5,I confess to bias...I adore Sidney Bechet,"This disk captures performances he gave in France, where he lived for years. (He was French Creole and spoke French from his childhood.) If you share my husband's and my enthusiasm for Bechet, don't let this disk get away from you."
249,2,"Very interesting subject, horribly written","I was really interested in reading this book, honestly. But it is so poorly written that I gave up after 30 pages or so. I don't care if it's important stuff, true or whatever. If the writer can't get the job done of explaining it he should leave it to somebody else. It seems he just poured his notes from his journal on the paper in a chronological order, with no overall plan.I give it a second star for the subject matter. If it was for the telling I'd want my money back."
250,1,BioTutor is lame,BioTutor is the worst educational software I have ever purchased. I trusted the reviews that were posted and was a total fool for doing so. It is simply pretest questions with written explanations if you need them. I can't believe they consider this interactive. I could get this from doing the pretests in the back of my book. I will be sending this software back!
251,1,It's no where near the best,"I was convinced that after the great reviews of this product this had to be the best on the market. Unfortunately, it was not. Frankly it's the worse I have ever tried. There really is no tutoring at all, it's all questions and if you want the answer you would have to click ""answers"" and it gives you a useless explanation. Not to mention the mistakes in some of the answers.I'm almost certain that 95% of the 5 star posts are bogus. It's impossible for an actual user to be impressed with this product. I returned mine two days after using it. This product is the WORSE in the market, I'm almost sure."
252,5,A great tool for exams!,I have some of my biggest exams ahead of me in the next week. About a month ago I wasn't sure if i was going to be able to understand all of the information that we've been going over for the entire year of biology. There were some parts that i was really struggling to understand. When i got a hold of BioTutor Excalibur i quickly put it to use. I first attempted just some of the chapters we were on. After seeing how much they helped me with what we were studying i began to use every chapter such as a practice exam. I really feel like i am now ready to take this exam. Thanks BioTutor!
253,1,LONG DELIVERY TIME,"Just a note: I tried to order this CD 05.12.2000 and had to cancel the order 22.01. after 4 delay notes. Process as such OK but 1-2 week delivery time is definitely optimistic... br, SK"
254,5,Castro Is A Monster,"I read this book years ago and now I am writing this because I have come across another book,Tortured for Christ, that I will be picking up. A few years before that was published, however, this one was. Let me tell you, after reading this gripping, sad and eventually triumphant (how else would he have been able to get this in print?) story, I never, never again had any shred of respect for Castro. I probably didn't anyway, but ignorance doesn't excuse it. After reading this, I have never trusted anything I have heard or read about that man or his regime if it purports to be something ""good"" about communist Cuba. Not the people, the regime. This story is one that needs to be read and shared, especially now as we seem to moving toward ""de-thawing"" the relationship with this thug. I don't pretend to know much more than what I have read and seen. I'm not of Cuban descent. For what people may think of this dictatorship, this book brings out some sad accuracy."
255,5,Humbling & Challenging Story,"I first got hooked on autobiographies, when I read a book by Richard Wurmbrand. Then a friend told me about this book and I got it immediately, and read it in about 2 days. I'm not a reader, like seriously, I don't enjoy reading at all. But I couldn't put this book down. Noble Alexander was an incredible man of God and I am humbled and challenged when I read his story. This book will change your life!"
256,2,Double Shuffle,"When on a dark, sinister night, a woman is found wandering around Paris' 4th arrondissement suffering from amnesia. The story sounds somewhat controversial for the fact that it appears at first to be a simple case of a missing person turned up, but all of a sudden, the initials of the leading Chinese atomic scientist are found with tattoo on her buttock. This is just the starting point of a real tension-tensed and dramatic adventure of suspense and intrigue into the world of international espionage and shrewd illumination shrouded in a thrilling and fascinating breathtaking conclusion."
257,5,First class all the way,"This is a terrific book with terrific material to present. It is part of a wonderful series. The organization, text, photos, and drawings are all excellent. More authors/publishers should learn to present architecture this well. It's a book I study often for inspiration as Forbes' work is very elegant and spare: qualities more architects should aspire to incorporate into their work, rather than the stylistic faddish gestures all too common today. This is a favorite book in my library."
258,4,Snorre,"Written in Nynorsk, very hard going for someone who only reads Bokmaal as second language. To my surprise, a friend who reads Swedish undestands the language of the book better than I do. Swedish is apparently closer to old Norwegian than is Bokmaal. What's needed for success: a very good Nynorsk-English or Nynorsk-Bokmaal dictionary. However, the reproductions of paintings by Jarle Rosseland would make the book worthwhile even if you can't read it! The feeling of the saga era is strongly captured and protrayed in those pictures. Where to find the book: through a second bookshop in Oslo. I bought mine new in Oslo in 1993.According to the Vinland Saga, Snorri is also the name of the first European child born in America."
259,5,Drinking the Koolaid,"Like the other reviewers, really like these levels. Not as pictured. Rubber ends are now yellow not black and the center vile is trimmed with yellow plastic minus the two screws shown. All that aside, they arrived dead solid perfect no thanks to the scant packaging. The levels themselves are great."
260,3,I like it -- it's refreshing!,"Characters in this book are nice, for the most part, but neurotic. They engage in zany and ill-conceived attempts to fix relationships and repair psychic damage incurred in traumatic childhood incidents. The narrative is humorous, desperate and tragic at the same time. The plot reminds me of tall tales and yarns with an Irish twist -- the very real and believable mixed with you-can't-expect-me-to-believe-this events. I enjoyed it thoroughly! Passages describing sibling and mother-daughter conversations are hilarious and irritating -- just like the real thing."
261,3,No residue,"I liked this book well enough when I read it; as other reviews said, it's sort of silly and fun. But two months after reading it, it's left absolutely no impression."
262,3,"Ornamentals, Ornamentals, and Ornamentals!","I bought this because I love Nova Scotia and homesteading (and own land there where I hope to live). This book is one couple's experience trying to live on a remote farm on Cape Breton Island. It has some good information, but is less about homesteading than about growing flowers.The most detailed information was on the different flowers they grew - lots about the many species and cultivars they tried. There is a section with some recipes. There is a bit about how and why they came to homestead. There is some writing about landscape design philosophy. But the thing that holds the book together is flowers.The title invokes both the practical and the aesthetic, but compared to other homesteading books, this one is really about the delight of growing flowers in a challenging maritime climate."
263,3,Not an up to date guide,"This is a good tale, but the couple uses many invasive plants which are NOT to be introduced into our landscape as they take over native plants and leave our pollinators without food sources."
264,1,pointless documentary,I mistakenly purchased this due to the similarity with the cover and STALINGRAD - DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER. This turned out to be just a pointless documentary on STALINGRAD like so many that had gone before. My bad...
265,4,Great documentary,"Excellent documentary with impressing images of the battle in the winter russian.However, the sounds it's not good. Subtitles in english could be better."
266,4,Great and intense...,"I am a histroy buff, and I thought this was a great movie. Very intense, very good quality production, war is indeed hell...."
267,2,Fine film ruined by voice-overs on this DVD.,"A solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice-overs by poor actors. Both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best. If you are averse to dubbing of fictional films, you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous. Clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles. But in the age of DVD it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film."
268,4,good for the price,"I just purchased this item from amazon. Its quality is just average. But with 2 knives for less than 10 dollars, it is a good deal. By comparison on average, a retractable knife at HD cost $10. The best quality utility knife I has is a retractable Lenox. Just holding it will convince you, but it costs 15 dollars for one knife.Its quality deserves 3 stars, but the price give it one more."
269,1,Irwin Utility Knife,"The fixed unit is ok, but a folding utility knife is better. The sliding unit is junk. The blade does not stay in the knife. Easy to change the blade, but who cares if the blade won't stay put."
270,5,Brilliant!,"I have been a punk fan for about 2 years now, and never have I heard such a strong debut album (I think it's their debut). Two of my favourite bands are Lagwagon and Ten Foot Pole. In my opinion, this CD is like a combination of the two bands. The harmonies and melodies are like those characteristic of Lagwagon, and the singer sounds like Dennis from TFP. Put this together with the lightning fast drumming of, say, NOFX, and there you have Over It - The Ready Series."
271,5,Its Williams...,Every cartoony thing the man has done... Early through Zap and into the 90's. No more need be said. (his commentary is worth the price.
272,5,No Bridge too Far,"As a former combat engineer of the Vietnam War era, I liked this series because it shows some good history of my field. It has some great old photos which will make this series good for preserving history. Combat Engineers may not get the glory of the Infantry, Armor or Artillery units, but they are vital to any war effort, and this series demonstrates that fact. I am looking forward to the next episodes."
273,5,Halley will ROCK your world,I really love this CD. Halley's songwriting and lyrics combine an incredible emotional depth with a powerful rock and roll sound that will blow you away! These songs have a groove that will make you wish you were dancin' in a club when you listen to them. You'll want to listen again and again to catch every word of the soulful lyrics.cerrato@ptechinc.com
274,2,alright,"I bought this pillow after finding out a hotel I stayed in used the same. I don't if it was the product I received but it wasn't as comfortable as I remembered in the hotel and after few washes, the comfort level started to plunge as the feathers started to poke. I won't spend my money on this ever again!"
275,5,Love this Pillow,I went to a Hilton and slept on the most comfortable pillow and then bought it. I love the softness of the down with the firmness of the foam that also keeps the quills from poking me in the head.
276,1,Disappointment,"Followed the instructions on fluffing, still the pillow is terrible. Purchased a pair of down pillows from Sam's for $16/pair, this horrific investment cost around $45 and I don't use it at all. Stay away."
277,4,"So far, so good","This reasonably priced, sturdy refrigerator seems to be doing the job it advertised. A great value for this discounted price, it is also an attractive item for your kitchen, bar or pantry. I don't know if they had Houdini doing the counting, though...I cannot possibly imagine how one could configure it into holding SEVENTEEN (!) bottles of wine!"
278,1,Too Warm or Too Cold,Looks great. Fits our space. Holds right number of bottles for us. But temperature either 40 or 60 degrees. Neither good for storing wine. Cannot get the temperature we want. Would send it back. But major undertaking for me--too heavy and bulky. Keeping as extra frig.
279,3,Cooler not a chiller,This product would be better is listed as a beverage cooler rather than a wine cooler. The flat racks better serves storing cans or flat items rather than round bottles. It is easy to setup and use and is very quiet.
280,4,Nice ltttle fridge,"I bought this to use as extra space when my husband comes home from the farmer's market with too much stuff. I didn't want one with the tiny freezer. And I wanted one with an old fashioned compressor, because I try not to use the AC much. It cools quickly, and hardly makes a sound..a faint hum and a few gurgles from time to time. I cant hear it at all from the next room. On a very humid day, which is every day of a Baltimore summer, there is condensation on the front glass. I inserted a piece of the packing styrofoam on the inside and it helps. So I guess the front glass panel is not well insulated...but for 99 dollars from a big box store...its a pretty good deal....I have had it a few weeks. I know compressors can last varying lengths of time...it is the luck of the draw. I will try to remember to update in a year or when it fails...."
281,1,Good fridge while it lasts.......,This wine cooler is thermoelectric so it takes some time to cool 16 bottles that are inserted at room temp down to 55 degrees. The unit worked well and was relatively quiet when it was running. All you hear is a little fan running that cools the thermcooling fins on the back.HOWEVER-I bought this unit as a gift for my wife along with a two year warranty. Good thing to because one year and one week after purchase the unit died. Have been getting the runaround from Warrantech who don't return calls and don't really care that I have spent a month trying to get either this unit serviced or a replacement unit. I think that I will go with another brand when I buy my next one.
282,1,Disappointed,"After reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through Amazon, I ordered this item, hoping it would work. It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine."
283,1,DANBY DWC172BL WINE COOLER,I NEED MORE TIME TO EVALUATE THIS PRODUCT.I AM TRYING TO ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE.SUGGEST YOU SEND ME THIS REVIEW AT A LATER DATE.
284,4,An Excellent Movie,"It's intelligent, insightful, and very funny. Brilliant performances by Julie Walters and Michael Caine in a story that you wish was true. I see very little that can be improved here, and it's one of those very rare films that I'll put back on my little shelf to watch again later."
285,3,quality and service,"The above named VCR arrived as promised in a timely fashion and it was factory sealed. Unfortunately the quality of the tape was poor. When I contacted the seller, he offered to return my money if I returned the VCR to him. Hence I am satisfied with the expedient way the problem was solved"
286,4,Caine is fantastic,"All I can say is Caine is the bomb and he makes alot of his ""I need beans"" expressions in this film!"
287,4,Totally great,"First off - just before I start - Rita is not Cockney. Cockneys come from the East End of London, which is in the Southeast. Rita is a Scouser (like The Beatles) who comes from Liverpool, in the Northwest. Just wanted to clear that one up!I watched this in an English lesson at school, and Walters and Caine give two of the finest performances of their respective careers. The story might be predictable, but that's one of the best things about it. Anything by Willy Russell gets my vote, anyway. Maureen Lipman is also fab."
288,3,"Lively performances, predictable writing","Educating Rita is a kick, with a wonderful performance from Julie Walters at its heart. Michael Caine, too, is perfectly cast as a poet long since turned to the bottle. Watching those two play off of one another is good fun; they breathe life into the pat writing. When the story wanders out to follow either character out in the world, the minor characters are much less well rounded. (She has a loutish cockney husband and family, he has intellectual friends who bring wine to parties. Surprised?)If you understand the basic outline of the plot here -- cockney young woman trying to raise herself in charmingly spirited fashion, professor in his cups who finds the upstart refreshing -- you aren't going to be surprised by where the story goes. Educating Rita does handle all the likely turns with grace, though, and that lets you concentrate on appreciating the acting. The movie's very watchable and has a good heart."
289,3,Incoherent,"This movie features fine performances and appealing characters. Unfortunately, the script is a mess. It begins very promisingly with the story of a tough lower-class girl who comes to be educated by a previously bored literature professor. But then it just peters out - the prof and Rita go their separate ways too soon, and the prof is a drunk who tears up his own writings and then hops on a plane to Australia in what I suppose is meant to be a happy ending even though nothing has been resolved. Rita does get educated, but it isn't much fun when it happens because we're too busy trying to follow the overlong, twisted screenplay. Needed a good rewrite."
290,1,soundtrack,can any body please tell me who made the music for the soundtrack?i want to know please tell me.thanx
291,2,the most boroing movie,Rating **Michel Cane Frank I believe that he was a pathetic actor and he really looked like he was just doing it for money. They should have probably chosen a better person to play it. I give Michel a 3 for his acting. Julie Walters Rita I believe that she played a good role in her person and she fitted it really well. Julie I give here a 10 for her acting. Well because Frank Michel was suck a bad actor I believe that there is no two incidents that I want to discuss but instead of Frank going to Australia by him self he should of gone to Australia with Rita. So the ending really sucked. I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 because I did not really get into the movie.
292,1,Educating Rita - the most sleepless movie I've seen,"The movie 'Educating Rita' is a film about a drunken professor, Frank, played by Michael Caine, who begins to tutor Rita, played by Julie Walters, who is a hairdresser from the lower class of society. Michael Caine wasn't acting very well, he always seemed tired and bored. Rita had a very annoying voice, so I couldn't sleep during the movie (good one!). Julie Walters didn't suit the role, she just didn't seem to enjoy it, as well as not being very good at it. I didn't like the ending, where Frank went to Australia. The best part was where Rita was arguing with Denny, who then went and burnt her books. I give it a 1/5 because I couldn't sleep during the movie"
293,4,Delightfully Poignant,"I believe in the power of education to change people, so as a university professor myself, this is one of my favorite films. Michael Caine, one of the most prolific actors of our time, and Julie Walters both provide memorable performances. And there are wonderful nuances in this film. Notice, for example, how Rita (Walters) has trouble with the door handle as she tries to enter Frank's (Caine's) office the first time. Others have pointed out some of the technological shortcomings on this DVD, but the heartwarming content overshadows any of these non-fatal flaws and makes it a winner nonetheless."
294,1,British DVD doesn't work on US machines,The DVD did not play on my American DVD player. It would really nice if this compant pointed out that this DVD is British and not calibrated for US DVD machines.It was a DVD for an assignment that set me back with little time to find a copy to complete my assignment. I will not order from this compant again.
295,5,A mesmirizing Michael Caine,"I saw this movie years ago in the theatre, and it totally captivated me. Julie Waters and Michael Caine make a wonderful student and teacher team. You can feel sorry for Michael Caine's character, with his drinking and feelings of worthlessness. I wish I had had a relationship with my teachers as Julie Waters has with Mr. Caine in this film. The end scene at the airport, leaves you feeling that both characters really had found a type of love for each other. It is a beautiful moment when Michael Caine hugs Julie Waters. Watch the facial expressions on both actors, and you will feel a deep warmth in your heart. Watch this video and enjoy and discover what is a keepsake of unspoken love.Sue"
296,4,For a cool & mellow head in todays world.....YOU NEED THIS!,"If there ever was an album that says ""Roll Another Number"" it's this mellow, funky little gem. Whenever I listen to this I want to call up the bro's for a BBQ, chill out with some 40's rollin' fatties and talkin' about the ladies. OH YEAH!! If you like this music check out ""Jalamanta"" and Che- ""Sounds of Liberation"" if you can find'em. This is music for the people..Get it on!!"
297,5,"FULL VOLUME, FULL POWER TRIP!","brant bjork's music is complete. This is dense,juicy rock. the type of stuff that you'll crank in the car driving 100 miles an hour in the middle of the night.the small minds of rock critics would lean on the old ""stoner rock"" cliches, but Bjork's stuff is beyond that. these are good sounds...true,thick, spacey, simple. the grooves nail you in the gut and keep you awake through the dark of night. LOUD is the word!"
298,4,buy it,"This album rules.its different the other stoner stuff hes played on but who evers listened to Che will know what to expect. it kind of remnds me of a more funkier masters of reality. i can see how some wont appreciate it but you cant please everyone. go for this if you like it mellow, chilled out and melodic"
299,1,"I can't listen, them........","I understand lowbut,I would like listen BRANT BJORK & OPERATORSIN THIS SITE. IN OTHER TIME, PERHAPS.THANKS"
300,5,John Bryan Bulb book,"This is an excellent reference book, listing all types of bulbs, from the common garden variety to the more obscure varieties. Listings also include all the hybrids and new cultivars. The book is well set out with many colour photos of the different species. A must for any home library and avid gardeners anywhere."
301,1,Out-dated views on a chiropractic career.,"Dr. Sportelli has apparently made the decision to provide a very limited view of a chiropractors role. Chiropractic is not about back pain, it is concerned with the removal of interference to the nerve system, thereby allowing the body to function closer to its potential. Chiropractic has never been about ""LOW BACK PAIN""---it is this type of misconception which has permeated our society and continues to be spurred on by texts such as this. Dr. Sportelli graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in the 1950's. He most certainly was not taught such nonsense at Palmer, for his pigeon-holed concept is not taught there, nor at any other good chiropractic college. Chiropractic recognizes and deals with the bodies inborn mechanisms. Dr. Sportelli's book was quite a disappointment in this and other respects. My advice, pass this one by and talk to someone at a college such as Palmer, Sherman or Life College and get the facts."
302,5,Love the music,"Great music, really surprising. My demographics - over 60, white male, big into music in 1960s and 70s, not so much now, listen to the best jazz station in the nation 91.1 or KCSM.org. Still rock out. Was a berkeley type for decades. I have seen Johnny Otis three times starting in 1964. Still didn't realize the tremendous variety of his music. Real R&B (not the crap they call R&B today), jazz, blues, race record pop sounds, rock and roll. Great album. Get it."
303,2,There are better choices,"Bought this book along with Fodor's 05 New York City Guide and New York Eyewitness Travel Guide for our trip to New York in August. Overall this was the least informative book. The biggest problem is that the book mainly focuses on where to eat and where to stay, not what to see. If you want a book that details sights better, I would pick Fodor's 05 New York City Guide. I carried the book with me almost every day in New York, while the Frommer's guide was left in the hotel room to press flowers from the botanical garden."
304,3,OK for background info but needs better maps,"I bought this book while preparing for my trip to NY and liked the Suggested NYC Itineraries section as well as how the subway stations, websites, hours, etc are listed. However, once in NY, I realized that what I really needed was a good subway map and detailed map useful when walking around. The book includes a map but I found it to be quite useless since not all streets are listed. (The map looks detailed enough to navigate yourself but it doesn't have enough detail of areas such as SoHo or Greenwich.) Even if the subway information changes frequently, I wish it had included a basic subway map so that I could navigate the system easier."
305,3,good book,"The book was in good shape.There was some underlining, but only in the first few chapters, and it didn't diminish the value of the book.I enjoyed the book very much."
306,2,"Paris, Wyoming","First off, my copy, Hudson House Publishers is a subsidy and self-publishing company. In old terminology, ""Vantage Press"" publishing. James paid to publish his novel. PARIS, WYOMING came as a gift as I generally do not purchase subsidy or self-published books or novels. Most do not exert ""tight"" editing and consist of numerous passive voice verbs and common writing errors. Secondly, I will finish this novel as my ""thank you"" to the one giving this gift. To complete reading PARIS, WYOMING, Wyoming will take forever. Lastly, whatever is the ""Wyoming Writers, Inc. 'New Horizons Award'"" as Jim James is a recipient?"
307,1,6 foot not 6 inches,Amazon sent wrong cable to me twice... the picture and description clearly show a six inch cable. Original order and replacement were wrong.
308,2,Very Dry -like a tastless piece of bread-- why eat it?,"Sorry, I only read the first 35 or 40 pages. The recounting of legislative actions was too uninteresting. I am interested in tid-bits of human activity. So I put the book down, and will not waste my time with it. People like F.D. R. are boring, whereas the farmer and the housewife, working their way through life, make history."
309,4,THE POOR ARE WITH YOU ALWAYS...,"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this over book forty years ago, are still sound today."
310,4,THE POOR ARE HERE TO STAY...,"This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today."
311,4,Good Read,"I had to read this book for my History 1302 class and I must say I'm glad I chose this book out of all the others. The book was very easy to read, however, it sometimes gets confusing when all the facts about poverty are referenced at the same time. Although this book is short, at certain times it feels like Harrington is dragging out his ideology. Nonetheless, This book opened my eyes to the poverty in America not only in the past, but at its' present state."
312,1,Outdated,"I was bored. I want real stories and examples. I read ""There are no Children here"" and loved it!!! I read somewhere that the author was inspired by this book, so I couldn't wait to get it. My guess is this author is a liberal, and not objective. The information was boring and one sided. I would have probably liked it more if the time frame was more current. I want to know more about today, not the 60's."
313,5,What a Wonerful book!,"I have been teaching Reiki for many years using different books, finally there is a book that is clear and has all the correct information in a format a beginner can understand. This book explains the Reiki story so clearly without disclaiming the original story that appears in most other Reiki books. The pictures of the hand placements are wonderful and I like the additional placements also. I believe the stories throughout the book add a special dimension showing the flexibility and depth that Reiki can be used. This book has taken the number one position in my Reiki library. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
314,5,Excellent for me - a beginner,I highly recommend this Reiki book. It is a wonderful guide for a beginner like myself. The photos are clear and the writing is interesting and insightful.
315,1,One of the worst Mozart #23 by a professional pianist,"A mediocre performance by a professional pianist. By playing the 3rd movement of Mozart #23 without looking the CD label, you would think this could be a pretty good amateur young player performing at a local winning concert. Didn't hear any elegance of Mozart. Sorry for the renowned orchestra."
316,3,"Yeah it ""was"" hot, but isn't a timeless piece of work.","I'm coming back to an old review and re-editing it. Unfortunately, I have found Rainer Truby's work a little stale over the last two years. The problem with most of these albums is that the mixer gets stuck with a trend-setting style, then does not do anything else with freshness. This isn't a timeless piece of work."
317,5,The sunny side of latin-inspired nu-jazz,"With such names as Jazzanova, Rainer Truby Trio, MAW, Ian Pooley and Cujo (aka Amon Tobin), this compilation could do no wrong. Tracks were selected by Rainer Truby, a well-respected Compost project, and a guy with a low profile and a great musical instinct (check out his Glucklich series). UK's Nuphonic, along with SF's Ubiquity, is TMHO the world's no 1 label in dancefloor-friendly nu-jazz; watch out for their releases, and let everybody else wait 1-2 years for the next 'ground-breaking' and 'genre-defining' compilation from Guidance."
318,1,Oprah's next pick,"""Schmaltzy and vacuous"" pretty much covers it, though one might also add that this novel consistently attempts to pass off conventional wisdom as insight and panders to the lowest literary common denominator while trying, through understatement, to pass itself off as art. Should sell a million copies-- look for it as Oprah's next pick."
319,1,Horrible book...,"I had to read ""Jim the Boy"" for my freshman english course summer reading and thought that it was a horrible choice. It had no substance and was too easy to read. Although some apparently disagree, not a good choice for anyone over four years old."
320,3,Pleasing,"Well written and sweet, but rather slow. Some characters were somewhat difficult to relate to, rendering their decisions and actions puzzling."
321,4,"A simple story of another era, well-told","JIM THE BOY is a slight, sweet tale, told in a voice as true as childhood itself. Perhaps its most important lesson is that the word ""father"" can have countless meanings, all of them important. While this may not exactly be the ""great American novel,"" I enjoyed Tony Earley's simple story of a Depression-era southern boyhood immensely. It has an ageless appeal that will span generations. Well done. - Tim Bazzett, author of LOVE, WAR & POLIO and the REED CITY BOY trilogy."
322,4,Sweet Read!,"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a sweet novel set in North Carolina during the late 1920's. Unlike other books set in the South of recent memory, though, this book doesn't describe an abused young man or a dysfunctional family but rather one of great strength.Although Jim's father dies only a matter of days before he was born, Jim is raised by his mother and three uncles who never married. Throughout the book, it is these men, who earn their livelihood from farming, who teach Jim some of life's greatest lessons. From learning how to hoe a field to confronting a firends devestating illness to seeing the grandfather he never knew as this old man lays dying, we as readers journey along as Jim experiences life between his tenth and eleventh birthday.Reminiscent of the equally lyrical style found in Plainsong by Kent Haruf, this book is a pleasant read for a summer's day."
323,5,A Treasure,"This is a book about the spiritual nourishment of a young soul. It is as patiently and impeccably crafted as a fine piece of simple furniture, made without glue, nails, or embellishment. Smooth and beautiful without a false or unnecessary move. Very few authors today have that restraint, finesse, and wisdom."
324,5,A beautiful book that reaffirms love and faith,"This book will do more to restore the human heart andantimaterialism than all the polemical works in the world. It isabout dignity and faith, sure of hand, deceptively simple. Buy it. Treasure it. Share it..."
325,4,brilliant,"The readers who call this 'children's fiction' are missing the point. this novel is an homage to books (like 'the yearling') that remind us why life is good. it counters the trend of life-as-angst. remember reading novels that made you feel GOOD? probably its been since grade school, right? This book isn't for kids; they'd miss all its symbolism and subtlety. it will remond you why you loved reading in the first place. even its cover art made me smile."
326,5,BEAUTIFUL! (I can think of no other word to describe it),"Tony Early tells the story of Jim with such straight-forward simplicity that you forget that you are, in fact, just reading a book. You can feel the heat of the sun on the boy's shoulders as he spends a day with his uncles in the corn field; feel his yearning to know the father who died just a week before he was born. I could go on, but I can't top Early. Go read this book! I doubt that I'll read a better one this year."
327,1,This Is a Very Boring Read,"For some reason I thought this novel was for adults although in retrospect looking at the cover should have told me otherwise. Set in the South, North Carolina, it is the story of Jim who never knew his father. The guy died at 23 of a heart attack, and his widow remained faithful to him, never considering remarriage. However, Jim has the love and support of his three unmarried--bachelor?--uncles. They live on a farm, and this is a sort of coming-of-age story. Quite possibly adolescents might like it. But it is a dull, dull read."
328,5,Wonderful book,"Probably one of the better short character novels written in recent time.Mr. Early has caught the feelings, time and people of this part of NC in a way that, I think, few have ever done. The wonderful relationships between a boy, his mother and uncles is as close to what a truly caring family could ever be.Read this book."
329,3,Book Club selection: Super Easy Read,"So this book took me only a day to read which: Awesome because I didn't have a lot of time this month. It was a simple story so I'm not sure what there is to discuss at the book club, I guess we'll have to see. Worth the read, definately G rated so read it to your kids."
330,1,Let's face it - I hated it!,"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I often love to read the recommendations of others, but after this experience I will be more cautious! This book was quite simply one of the more boring books I've ever read. Its simple-minded prose irritated me to the point of distraction. I was grateful for the distraction though, because the prose itself was mind numbing. The chapters could just as well have been titled: ""Jim almost meets Ty Cobb!"" ""Jim Climbs A Tree!"" ""Jim Gets A Baseball Bat!"" and the titles would sum up every piece of action contained. The characters were lifeless and virtually indistinguishable from each other."
331,1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Jim the Boy is terribly overrated, with a cast of cardboard characters and a wooden tone. Apparently many critics don't know how to distinguish between spare, basic prose and dumbed-down bad writing. The author is probably laughing his way to the bank, especially now that a sequel has been published. I'll just let them fall all over themselves and take a pass. God forbid there should be a movie forthcoming."
332,3,Slow read but has some touching MOMENTS!,I bought this book as part of the BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB and started to read it and put it down after about 30 pages thinking I could never make it through. Then a few days later I picked it up again and finished it. It is one of the slowest reads I have ever read and has a horrible ending. It just sort of ends when there is so much more to be told. But the reedeming quality is in the relationships between Jim and his relatives. If not for that it would have received 1 star.
333,1,Worst Book I have ever read,"This is like my first try at writing - over-used plot, short chapters, small vocabulary, typical charachters. This book shows no writing skills whatsoever. Look at its title. ""Jim the Boy"". Very original.Yet the dialogues freaked me out the most:""..."" Jim said""..."" Uncle Coran said""..."" said Jim""..."" Uncle Zeno said.The word ""said"" probably has the greatest number of synonyms, but Earley never used any other word.The plot is an ""oh so sweet"" typical plot that I have seen so many times. Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it. If I didn't have to read this book for my school, I would never have read it beyong the 20th page."
334,1,Sentimental and embarrassing,"This novel might be OK for children, but for grown-ups it's an overly idealized (to put it mildly) fantasy of depression-era Southern life. I kept expecting Andy and Opie to come walking in, carrying their fishing poles; at least something funny might have happened, that way. But this earnest, plodding book about an unbelievably good world is actually kind of an insult to the way southern people really lived in the 1930s, black and white. What was the author thinking?"
335,3,A pleasant but not inspiring read,"A big fan of Tony Earley's short stories, I could hardly wait for his first novel to come out. But I was disappointed. Though it is certainly a fine book, it felt a little thin, more like a stringing together of short stories than a novel. Even so, it is a pleasant read. And I like Tony Earley so much that I feel terrible not giving him a better review! I am sure his next book will be awesome."
336,4,Lovely little book,"Jim the Boy by Tony Earley is a wonderful novel...beautifully written, poetic without being overblown or contrived, moral without being preachy. I recommend it highly."
337,3,Kinda simple....,"""Jim the Boy"" was an alright read however I think that I was expecting something written more for adults and I felt this book was geared towards adolescents over adult readers. It is a really good story-line, however, didn't really make my brain work too much while reading it. What I really liked about the book was the simplistic lifestyle that was described, somewhat similar to that of my late grandfather. So, that was a nice little fictional peak into what it was like for my grandfather growing up in that time period."
338,3,Jim Where Are You,Jim the Boy was so highly recommended that I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately I felt as if I had gone to a fine restaurant to eat a gourmet meal and discovered fast food on my plate. There were certainly moments that made reading the book worthwhile but I came away hungry.
339,2,"A book for kids, not adults","This is a pleasant, rather hokey coming-of-age tale that seems addressed to kids of 11 or 12, not to grownups. I don't understand why this isn't being marketed as a children's book, as it really has little to hold an adult reader's interest. The plot is very familiar and sentimental, and the writing is clear, uncluttered, and plain but not interesting in its own right. Buy it for your school-age son, but not for your father."
340,3,Warm,"I appreciate Tony Earley's craft, his simple, yet keen prose, masterfully guided. Yet, Jim the Boy is a novel in which lofty, sentimentalized ideals outweigh and ultimately obscure the characters. What resonated with me after reading the book was the unrecognizable face of Jim as a real boy."
341,4,COMING OF AGE IN NORTH CAROLINA,"Life during the Great Depression was harsh. We see it through the eyes of a ten year old, boy, Jim. Yet the simplistic rigors or farm life lend strength, discipline, and tenacity to this little boy coming of age in Aliceville, North Carolina. His widowed mother and three endearing uncles help Jim face the turning points in his life with courage. The illness of a friend, the coming of electricity, and the marriage proposal his mother receives expands his world, and his adventures in a different local begin anew. Through his eyes, we remember ourselves as children, and easily identify with his perceptions. Touching and engaging."
342,1,butchered tracks makes box set collection of coasters,"The george carlin box set suffers from the same kind of malady other comedy cd reissues suffer from: some engineer decided since there were ""tracks"" on the tape and vinyl album there must be tracks on the cds. This means that the last five seconds of a routine are often faded out and that the next routine starts abruptly, jarring the listener. What made Class Clown, Fm/Am, or Occupation Foole in terms of flow from one routine to another is now just cut and paste tracks. Doesn't anyone listen to the product before it is released? I returned the George Carlin box set and will now have to be very careful when I play my tapes. The problem is this is just a sign that cds are not all they are cracked up to be..."
343,5,EVERYONE should have this book!,"I often times have trouble thinking of gifts for my three grown children for Christmas. I ordered each of them Life's, ""One Nation"" and paged through it after it arrived. Not only is it beautifully put together, but it served as a reminder of the horrifying, heinous crime committed on all of the innocent people at the WTC and the Pentagon. If you ever questioned, for one second, our countries mission to find those cold hearted, controlling, crazy bastards, the book WILL remind you of the rage you felt the day it happened..guaranteed."
344,5,Excellent,"This book really showed patriotism. I loved it and the pictures were extreme. It was a great book for anyone, any age. I really enjoyed the book, but it made me sad."
345,5,Lest we forget,Pictures. These will remind you. Haunting. Sad. Heart wrenching. Moving. These words won't do it for you. The book will give you more. Over 3000 people died that day. This book will help you to never forget what happened to them and us.
346,4,"Excellent, almost perfect.","It is a beautiful book. Horrific, unforgettable images and a lot of tragic emotions. I would not mind to see a bit less of the American point of view, less sentimentality and more universal view, but that's only my opinion. Overall, it's a keeper."
347,2,I was disappointed.,"I have been searching for a book on 9-11 to hand down to future generations of my family, and I thought that I could not go wrong with a book published by Life. However, after perusing through the book I ended up returning it. If you are interested only in what happened in New York City, this is a great book--but the Pentagon and Pennsylvania incidents barely received a page or two of coverage. Since I live just a few miles from the Pentagon in Alexandria, Virginia and drive by the damaged side each day as I head toward Memorial Bridge to work, that is what I am interested in reading about. I am very disappointed that Life treated the Pentagon as a postscript."
348,4,A Good Commemorative,"This book contains some great photos of 9/11. Among the most striking are the dual page spreads on pages 72-73 and 92-93. Take a look for yourself at the unburnt paper everwhere and the satalite photo of the ""Dust Plume/Cloud"" respectively.Then do yourself a favor and take a look at the only foresic scientific study of the evidence.Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11"
349,5,best book ever,i just want to say this is one of the most moveing and inspiring books iv ever read.Its history and its worth every cent and more.i bought 5 books as gifts for christmas. and everyone loved them.every picture is detailed to what happend..and the storys in the book is from the personal lifes of everyone like fireman.police man.ect..you got to buy it ..!!!!Roger.
350,1,Extremely Disappointed,"When compared to some of the other wonderful literature that is available for children, this book doesn't have a leg to stand on. It was poorly written and rather boring. (...)"
351,1,Positivly Atrocious! Boring beyond reason!,"This book is boring,terribly written and dryer than a year old cracker. Saying that J.K Rowling plagurised this is a sheer insult to a great writer. My advice to the writer is take a little more time to actually write a good book instead of tring to sue other people! Seriously, I felt like a genuis trying to read Barney's play time! Take my advice and save some innocent tree in a forest somewhere, and don't buy this book! If you want to read this ridiculous excuse for a book visit a library!"
352,5,An useful catalog,"Just like all books on patterns, this gives you the feeling of 'oh, this is soooo obvious' the first reading it. The fact is that a second after reading it you start thinking and talking about brown bags, angles and evangelists and refer to the book all the time. Linda and Mary Lynn give us an idiom, a very very useful idiom.Also, the book is funny. Must read."
353,5,"Bill Engvall ""15 degrees off cool""","Bill Engvall is totally funny in this video, espically when he talks about taking his F16 flight."
354,5,How to tickle your funny bone.,"If you want to spend a fun evening with someone, watchingthis DVD is the perfect way to do it. It had us both institches. Bill Engvall is funny, funny, funny and doesn'thave to use foul words to do it."
355,5,One of my top 3 favourite funniest comics,I first saw 15degrees off cool on Comedy Central. I can't remember when last I laughed so hard. It was hilarious especially his last story about the air force.
356,4,cool,"Bill Engvall has been around for a long time and has produced some very funny CDs/DVDs. This is also great but not quite as good as previous efforts. Maybe Bill is a bit tired - what with movies, TV shows etc. Still worth buying however."
357,4,Helps save the furniture!,"Both my cats love to dig their claws into these cardboard scratchers. They're indoor/outdoor cats, and when they're in the mood to sharpen their claws, they tend to use whatever piece of furniture happens to be closest. I've never been able to break them of this habit, so these things are a godsend. As long as I keep several lying around, they'll use them instead of table legs and upholstered chairs."
358,5,All my Cats love Cosmic Pet Scratchers,"Since I am owned by nine cats and am grandmama to three more, I have bought numerous cardboard scratchers. Cosmic Pet Double Wide Scratcher is by far the best. The cardboard frame and scratcher are both durable, lasting many months. When one side is shredded, the scratcher can be turned over so the other side can be used. Packets of Cosmic Pet catnip are included for sprinkling over the scratcher. I think Cosmic Catnip is as good as my homegrown...much fresher looking and less junk-filled than many other catnip products. My cats certainly look forward to it. The double wide size is most suited for my fat cats."
359,5,PERFECT SCRATCHER!!,"We can't say enough about this cat scratcher. No other cardboard scratchers can come close to this brand. Plus, the extra wide version is wonderful for my big Ally/Tom cats. They are all around 12 pounds. We have three cats and two scratchers last quite a long time since you can flip them. They love to lay on them and even bite them. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful product!"
360,5,Review for Another Life,"In a selflessly honest appreciation for bare life, this book opens to a yearning for that which the modern human is in search of; the straining of life against its inevitable end to recapture innocence, grace before the fall, love, or what is even more mysterious, forever lost, and finally unattainable. The anxiety of these stories is deafening as you hope against hope for your own salvation along with the characters' in their quiet desperation for another life, so exigent as to be a matter of life and death; a struggle too unfathomable to dare come into consciousness, though felt every moment throughout the living flesh. You will find yourself in this book."
361,5,"The original, and perhaps the best.","This is the album in which the Sci-fi, metal saga of the Iron Savior starts. Kai Hansen's influence and style are more than evident here. For me it's one of the best albums of the 90's. The concept of the story is really good and the song writing and the performance brilliant.I would really like to see this concept taken into a big budget movie, is fantastic. The following 3 albums continue and expand the story, but this is the first episode. Great music and a great idea. Recommended to all metalheads."
362,4,Excellent Text for Business Writers,"As an instructor of business writing, the exercises in the text are excellent. The chapters a bit dense for the casual student. However, the overall work teaches and focuses on true problems in the work place. The e-mail and memo writing materials nail it."
363,3,very slow to mail & no response to customer questions.,"The book was being sent from my town so it should have been here the next day. I tried to contact seller but got no response ever! Very slow service, It wasn't even sent out until the day before the last day it was scheduled to be here & It came on the very last day. For a local company, I'd expect quicker service than this & at the least I'd expect some kind of response when I tried to contact them but I got neither. However, the book did arrive as advertised."
364,5,Comment about the textbook,Smooth transaction. Got my book on time. Recommend others to buy textbooks from this person.
365,1,"I still have not recieved the book I ordered 11-19. So I can't really give an opinion,",I still have not recieved my book that I ordered 11-19.I have filed a claim. I can not give an opinion about the book.
366,5,C-Murder iz on fire,This was one of c-murders best album also look at Bossaline and life or deathTRU RECORDS
367,4,C-Murder is back,1st OF I AM A NL FAN 4 LIFE C CAME TIGHT ON THIS 1 I DONT EVEN HAVE THIS BUT I HEARD EVERY SONG WHAT U BOUT IS DA BEST SONG ON THERE I GOT ALL C'S CD'S BUT THIS MIGHT BE BETTER THAN LIFE OR DEATH I SUGGEST EVERY NO LIMIT FAN 2 GET THIS ESPECIALLY 4 THE BEATS.
368,4,2nd best of the 3,"yo, c-murder comes out w/ his 3rd solo album here...not as good as life or death but much better than his last album he put out...i gave it 4 cuz 5 for the first 4 for the third and 3 for the second albums he has made...he seems to start on top fall and regain himself...he is one of the few rapers that has a mellow blend and sound...sure he doesn't have much new to say this time around, but whose to say that thats a bad thing....hes got a sound that many dont have and thats what keeps people listening to him and geting others to come to him.....no one else on no limit has the ideas he has...'p' is a sell out...and silkk just i dunno, hes up and down on every song he does...those r the three origionals and since mystikal has now left no limit.all they got to help em is c here...i say that you should get this album cuz not much sounds like it...solid effort and will be listenin to this more down the road..peace"
369,2,"Better beats, but C Murder is still on Tupac's jock",The beats on this CD are alot better than what No Limit has put out before. I just wish C Murder could get off Tupac's jock because he's got Tupacs flow all up in his mouth.
370,2,lack of a good rap voice and too many sample s,"altough some of the music is not bad and the lyrics aren't all that stupid the ridiculois voice of C-Murder make this album not an atractive hear, besides he uses a lot of samples"
371,4,Excellent cd,"This is probably C-Murder's best album yet! Too Much Noise is my favorite song from it but the other songs that I like on here are Concrete Jungle, How A Thug Like It, Want Beef, Ride, Staring At The Walls, On Da Block, What You Bout, Where Do We Go, NL Iggaz, That Calliope, They Want My Money, Down For My N's(which is the exact same song from Snoop Dogg's album No Limit Top Dogg), and Street Thugs. Thug In Yo Life is an ok song, but the beat is kinda weak. Oh yeah, and the Otis Commercial and the Interlude right after it are hilarious! If I had a choice I would give this album 4.5 stars but I can only give it 4. If you don't believe me, go check this album out today and see for yourself!"
372,1,if i could giv it 0 starz i would,"waste of money, do NOT get this, this is poser rip-off rap, at it's worst, c-murder blatanly rips off 2pac rhyming style, the beats are throwaway at best...they stock is crumblin"
373,4,Sometimes it is good to be trapped!,This is first cd he produced on his own so I cut him some slack. It is a original concept for his cd. I love the guest appearences and the albums rhymes.
374,3,"Lots of information, but frustrating","This book probably throws more information at you, page for page, than any other Visual Basic book I've seen. It covers everything from programming basics and general theory, all the way up to programming with databases. In that regard, it's an ideal book for the novice who wishes to explore deeper.Unfortunately, what keeps this from being a truly great textbook is some really sloppy editing. Explanations of concepts and tools are thorough to a fault, but they are just way too verbose. Here, a long explanation is used where a short one would have sufficed. And most inexcusably, I have found numerous errors in the project code that is included. I made it a challenge to myself to find out why the code was wrong and correct it, but not everyone has a learning style that allows them to benefit from this. Apparently, some of these problems are corrected in a third edition of the book that is forthcoming. Until that time, proceed with caution."
375,4,Good book for the beginner and advanced users,"A book able to explain VB 6 in simple words with simplicity,I just bought the book for a program (VB 98) dated back to 1998, but a good book from the use I am given to it. All the topics are treated with sense and simplicity, making the language of programming easy. Good for everyone interested to learn the basics of VB 98."
376,2,Do not read this book!!!,"If you enjoyed the rest of the series, stop and don't read this book. Yes, you will be left wondering what happens to the rest of the swords, who is the Emperor, what happens to Mark and the rest, but live with the curiosity. This book goes beyond anticlimactic, it is just awful. The ending and the explanation of the Emperor is so...I can't even find words for how disappointing it is.I'm left wondering if Saberhagen didn't outgrow the series and quickly wrote Shieldbreaker's story to bring the series to a close so he could move on to other endeavors. I can not believe that he actually thought that this ending would satisfy his readers.I can not stress enough how thoroughly disappointing and frustrating the ending of this book is. Saberhagen should personally apologize to everyone who read this book"
377,4,A different but surprising ending to an epic!,"I have read all of the series and I thought this was definately one of the best ones. I hated to see it end. My favorites though are the first 3 in the series. But this one was good and it had a surprise ending with some sci-fi thrown in. Fred Saberhagen is one of the all-time best in this genre, do yourself a favor and read his books."
378,3,"Great series, poor ending","I loved all of the swords series leading up to this book. The plots and characters were intrigueing and well woven. The first three are the best with the Lost Swords continueing admirably. The last book Shieldbreakers story is a fizzle of epic proportions. With the tremendous build-up from the rest of the series the ending was trite and hurried. The setting and explaination for the emperor was horrible. From the other books we see a great figure in the emperor, noble and mysterious. The explaination we end up getting is shockingly boring and increadibly disappointing. This book leaves the reader thinking, ""What? That's it? Where is the rest of it?"""
379,1,regretful,"If you loved the series please,please do not read the last book it will leave you totally disappointed to say the least!"
380,2,Unsatisfying ending makes a good book mediocre,"Most of the book was fine, but the end section was a poor conclusion to the book, and the series. (WARNING! Specific plot details follow!) Just so readers are forewarned, the Emperor is never explained, and he gives a strange quasi-religious statement about himself. Here it is, verbatim: ""Some long ago have called me the Sabbath, or the Covenant--Some have called me Wisdom. Some lately have said that I am the Program of Creation.""Has Saberhagen found Christianity, and he's trying to inject it into his fiction? What the heck is he trying to get at, here? Beats me, and the book left me scratching my head and wondering what happened to this gifted writer."
381,3,"Good, but missing something","I brought this one home for my daughter 2-1/2 yr old daughter from the library. The illustrations are wonderful and the storyline idea is very good. The mother bear is trying to involve her oldest cub in doing something for the new baby cub. However, my husband and I both found the responses of the Mother bear toward the oldest cub somewhat intolerant and insensitive. Finally at the end of the book the mother bear is warm and loving toward her eldest cub, but I'm not sure if that makes up for earlier responses. My daughter did seem to enjoy the book enough, but wasn't disappointed when it was returned to the library."
382,3,"Comprehensive, but disappointing","Very informative, but the vast majority of the photos are black and white! Not ideal. I would not have purchased the book had this been made known."
383,3,"Pretty Good, look for Fitzpatrick","I was introduced to this book in my junior-year analysis course called Adv Calc 1. At the time I found it to be very fun to read, mostly very clear in its presentation, and well-motivated. One drawback of this book is that the material covers only single-variable analysis, and then the reader who wants to learn multivariable calculus has to go to another book where he has to get used to different notation, different emphases, different definitions of continuity, etc. This is unfortunate for someone who wants a unified perspective.(As an aside, for Adv Calc II, my class used Friedman's Advanced Calculus, which I found impenetrable. I would not recommend this book.)Then I discovered Fitzpatrick's text Advanced Calculus, which covers both single- and multi-variable calculus. What's more, it outdoes Gaughan's text in terms of clarity, motivation, simplicity, and everything else. I can't recommend Fitzpatrick's book enough."
384,4,"A Good, Rigorous Introduction to Analysis","I used this book for an undergraduate course in Analysis and was pleased with it. It is well-organized with poignant examples. The physical construction of the book, however, proved not to be as good as the content and it is quite worn."
385,2,A little lacking,"I had to get this book for my advanced calculus class. There are 3 issues I have with this book. First, that the material in any given chapter gives what is needed to work most, BUT NOT ALL, of the problems at the end of the given chapter. Second, having solutions to selected exercises is a good tool to have, and if an instructor disagrees, he or she can just assign problems that don't have solutions given. Not all students would use those solutions, but it's nice to have to verify one is on the right track. Third, the author does not explain things as clearly as other authors do. He (assuming Edward is male) could have explained things much better without adding a single word to the text. I find myself frequently referring to 'How To Prove It' by Velleman, since Velleman explains things much better. In short, this book is not the worst I've seen, and I would give this book 3 stars, were it not for the price."
386,5,This refill works in my Whisker City Play Cavern Cat Scratcher,"I purchased this Cosmic Pet Alpine scratcher replacement kit and it fits perfect in my Whisker City Play cavern cat scratcher box. I just took the refill, pulled the two halves apart and have 2 refills for the Whisker City scratcher."
387,1,They don't fit,"These replacement pads are smaller than the originals, so they don't ""hook"" under the edges and when a cat gets their claw in it, it flies out of the scratcher. Useless!"
388,2,Good if you do not need to highlight a lot of information,"I bought these highlighters thinking that they would last for a long time. Being a college student, I have a lot that needs to get highlighted. These highlighters did not last me long at all."
389,3,Cash the Bad Guy,"Cash plays a villian who conspires with a mobster to rob a bank by kidnapping a banker's wife and demanding money. He plays a kind of derranged villian who hasn't a problem killing another person (except children). It's a decent, low-budget film, the kind of film you'll see on a Saturday afternoon on television--nothing remarkable. His acting is a bit stiff. He sings the song, ""Five Minutes to Live."" I've seen him in other, more exellent films. This one is for a collector."
390,4,a must for cash completest,"Johnny as a sociopath???? See it! If you are a fan you'll like it. Would have been a pretty good low budget thriler even without Cash, but it's a lot more fun with him."
391,3,To General,"I dont really think that this is a good book. I didnt know anything more after reading this book then I knew before reading this book. I found the most valuable information she provided was telling about how she saved money using interns, yet this was something that I already knew also."
392,1,Little practical advice,"When you are thinking about starting your own business, probably the last thing you need is this sort of fluffy advice to become ""mature"", wear a suit, and heavily network. I was hoping for more solid information, like the virtues of incorporating rather than being a sole proprietor and other real concerns of a small business person. Plus the author's ""voice"" really irritated me. There are *much* better books out there on this subject."
393,1,What book did the other reviewers read?,"I'm very disappointed with this book. Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success. Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit. She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead. After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money. There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories. Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A. Joseph are two of many that are a much better read for your time and money"
394,2,Hackneyed commentary by a johnny-come lately,"Not very interesting or informative. Better to buy a year's subscription to INC Magazine or Harvard's Entrepreneur Book.There is very little new information provided here. In fact some, of the information is leads the reader astray from 1999-2000 issues (LLC's, tax implications, true cashflow analysis)"
395,4,Very balanced and fair.,This is one of the few religious books that just tells one side (the Roman Catholic faith) with no antagonism to any other side and no self-righteous pontificating! It is also very accurate as to what the Catholic Church professes to believe and why. This makes it a good book for non-Catholics to read who just want to know what Catholics really believe and function in their church.But it no easy read. This book is for serious study and not recreational reading.
396,3,"Fairly written, not one-sided","I thought it was a very general book. It did not talk about the more detailed customs and traditions that intrigue me about Catholicism. However, I was very impressed about the detail of what was discussed. The arguments were very fair to both Catholic Christians and Christians. The information was interesting, thorough and fairly presented. It doesn't answer everything and so you are left with the FAITH that the Holy Spirit leads you to."
397,5,Great Re-Introduction to Christianity,"I am in the process of converting to Catholicism after being raised Presbyterian. I found this book not only to be an easy-to-read and understand explanation of the basics of Catholic catechism, but an outstanding reminder of what Christianity means, should stand for and should strive to be.The topics are in depth, and there are subtle references to refute fundamentalist arguments often heard in 21st century America.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it!"
398,5,Good gift selection,"I usually read more than one book together and found this a very good companion to Vatican II, the Crisis and the Promise. Even though, I am aware of most of the issues that are covered in these books, I find Alan Schreck to be an interesting writer on these topics. I find both books easy late night reading unlike many others that actually help me to go to sleep. I have actually found it hard to put down these books until I finish a chapter. His writings are highly readable and thoroughly convincing."
399,5,The book I recommend most!,"Clearly written explanation of the specific areas where Protestants have the most difficulty with Catholic teaching. I bought two, just so I'd have one to lend and one to keep!"
400,5,"Readable, informative and non-judgemental","In the preface to this new, revised 20th anniversary edition of Catholic and Christian, author Alan Schreck reflects upon the centrality of the Eucharist at the core of the Catholic tradition as John Paul II calls us to enter the ""Year of the Eucharist"". This book covers all of the topics we Catholics are frequently asked about in conversation by our non-Catholic friends: Mary, the Communion of Saints, the Pope and more. The book is not only of value for its apologetic purposes, but also for any Catholic (or for individuals wanting to inform themselves about the Faith) who wants to learn more about the traditions at the core of our Church. The topics covered remain timely in an era when many are striving to understand the true teachings of the Church."
401,5,Quick reminder!,"I don't think I can say anything else that the previous reviewers haven't already noted. I have rated this book 5 stars simply because it earned it. However, I do have a quick reminder... that the book's purpose is to EXPLAIN, not to CONVERT."
402,5,"Clear, Concise explanations","I'm planning on loaning this book out to some of my Protestant friends who have misconceptions about Catholicism. Mr. Schreck successfully refutes such notions as ""the Catholic Church puts its own hierarchy above scripture,"" ""the Catholic Church teaches Pelagian works righteousness,"" and ""Catholics deify Mary and the Saints."" Mr. Schreck has done an excellent job of stating what Catholics really believe, as well as presenting the Scriptural foundations of those beliefs."
403,4,Identical(?) to ASIN B000008B9R,"Hodges & Davis were great, and I wish more of their stuff were readily available. But this one appears to be a duplicate of ""In a Mellow Tone"". It has the same two artists and the same track list as ASIN B000008B9R. (Damn. And there were so few albums of these guys as it was!)"
404,5,EXCELLENT!,"This is an excellent learning tool for those who want tolearn crochet. I'm an avid knitter but want to learncrochet especially in-the-round as I want to make my ownhats and caps, but I just couldn't find a book to get mestarted.This book has wonderful photos and close-ups of every technique.The projects are slanted towards younger adults but can beadapted for any age. A very well-thought-out book and easilyportable as it closes with its own velcro clasp. I highly recommend."
405,5,I Laughed The Whole Way Through The First Episode On This,"The first ep, on the tape is one where a new teacher shows up. If you've ever had a motivational speaker come to your school, this one will be hilarious. He is a perfect exaggeration of the people that always come to mine and I guess that's why I found it so funny. The second ep is where a new disciple shows up. He's totally against fighting and stealing, but is willing to do anything to learn master Happosai's techniques. This one's okay. I laughed a couple times through it, but overall any ranma fan should get this one. Plus Ukyo's in the first ep. My all time fav character. I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars except it wouldn't let me. This was a great xmas gift."
406,5,"Pug Fur Real toy, a real charmer!","I bought this for my adult friend who has a Pug, she just loves it, it is as cute as a button, all Pug-lovers would get a kick out of this little guy! Great transaction, speedy shipping, would highly recommend seller! Thanks!"
407,5,Eternal change and freedom to choose.,"""We shall break down all the walls-to let the green wind blow free from end to end-across the earth.""No ordinary SF novel, ""WE"" questions the wisdom of 1920's Russian body politik, The Party. Banned and suppressed there, even today, Zamyatin's distopian nightmare demands of the reader a re-thinking of their rights to choose and the necessity of eternal change, r/evolution.Earnest and beautiful, one man's personal diary of the events surrounding the legislation of mandatory brain operations within a hermetically enclosed city-state, is a subtle, terse and poetic examination of fear of, and need for freedom. I highly reccommended to anyone without hesitation. Zamyatin's philosophical enquiry is personal and lyrical"
408,3,Original dystopia,"_We_ is an interesting sci-fi look at ""perfect"" societies. It shows how perfection can go awry as the central government takes too much control.Sound a bit like _Farenheit 451_, _1984_, _Brave New World_, etc.? It should, because all these books likely took note of _We_. It was an originator of this genre._We_ is an interesting read, but overall, if you have read later dystopic novels, then it seems a bit frail at times.I would take the time to read _We_ for a couple of reasons. One, it's always interesting to see what an author tried to accomplish during Soviet oppression; and two, it's interesting to see the evolution of this genre and where it all began."
409,4,"Beautiful, personal and Misunderstood","This is more of a philosphy novel than anything else. There are intertwinnings with beautiful fantasy, pure logic and a personalisation that you will not find in 1984 or Brave N ew World. There are direct references to religion, science experiments that were the buzz of Zamyatin's time and still ring with us today.The main problenm with this book is for people to take it too seriously. This is partly a mix of an author's life and his fiction. The 70s feel is amazing considering the time it was written in. I recommend people not to take to heart that this book may have influenced 1984 and BNW because then you will read too much into this and not enjoy it."
410,3,The Mathmeticians Apocalyptic Vision,"Anyone who reads ""We"" and ""Brave New World"" will notice an astounding number of similarities, enough to make one wonder whether Huxley borrowed a little more than he should have. Nonetheless, this is a pretty good apocalyptic novel. I would rank it somewhere above the aformentioned ""Brave New World"" and below ""1984"". Perhaps the most interesting thing about the novel is the mathematical subtext. Zamyatin was a professional mathmetician and the names of his characters (which are numbers) supposedly are part of some master equation. Unfortunately, my Russian isn't up to reading the book in the original. Neither is my math, for that matter. But this is a quick read, very much a product of its time and location. It will probably take you an afternoon; and there are certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon."
411,4,We,"I have alot of interest in the books 1984, and Burgess's 1985 who also wrote Clockwork Orange. This book was hard to read and really didnt make alot of sense most of the time. Is more Science Fiction than anything else-not a view of the future. The main character is found to have a ""soul"" which of course makes him mentally ill. Has alot of History to it but not much relevance. But Im certainly not the best one to review this book. I enjoyed 1984 very much."
412,4,"The Canadian version of ""Managing Your Inheritance""","This is a fine resource, though a virtually verbatim adaptation, using Canadian $ and tax law, of the earlier ""Managing Your Inheritance"" by Card and Miller. Unless you are inheriting in Canada, get the Card and Miller book...."
413,3,Not the great mystery I was expecting.,"Touted as ""The greatest dectective story ever written,"" it was a very tangled story unraveling the mysterious death of Richard III's nephews. Do I care? I don't think so."
414,2,ATTENTION HISTORY LOVERS,"For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella, THE DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey. This is a mystery novel that deals a lot with English History and Old Kings and stuff, whic is something that I just don't mesh with. On a scale of one to ten I would have to rate this book a three. The reading was a bit hard, and I often found myself counting the pages until I was finished. Though I usually love mystery, this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels. The book was written well and I think that if I had been a tad bit older and wiser on English History that I may have enjoyed it more. Overall I think that I would personally have to give the book two thumbs down."
415,3,Interesting but a little boring and repetitive,This book was assigned to my class as part of a summer assignment. My teacher assigned the book to illustrate how history is distorted and to teach us how we should interpret historical documents and textbooks. I felt the fictional aspect was extremely boring and repetitive.
416,3,Richard the Third was guilty,"This book is very clever and well-written, and when I first read it at the age of about sixteen I found it totally convincing. Yes, yes, of course Richard was a nice man, of course he was innocent. It wasn't until year later when I read some real history books on the subject that I realised that the book is not sound history. A bedridden police inspector decides Richard must be innocent because he likes his face? That seems to me an extremely dangerous supposition to start from. If it was possible to tell if a person was guilty or innocent merely by looking at their face,then we could do away with trial by jury altogethere ""yes, m'lud, he's innocent, just look at his face"". Richard III usurped the throne from his nephews, imprisoned them in the tower, then they just happened to dissapear, whoops, he mislaid them? Just coincidence/ I don't think so. Read 'The Princes in the Tower' by Alison Weir if you're interested in learning what (probably) really happened."
417,3,Rewriting history,"It is an unique idea of digging into the historical crime of accused murderer King Richard and discovering the truth through factual records and the reports of people living at the time and it was well written but personally I couldn't work up a lot of enthusiasm about it.Honestly, most Americans have only a passing familiarity with English royalty and even less with their interwoven families and unless you are familiar with these people and CARE about who did what to whom and why the book becomes tedious very quickly.Now if it had been about whether George Washington really had chopped down the cherry tree or whether it was really a wheeping willow and his cousin who framed him for the arborcide then maybe I could have worked up more interest.I don't mean to belittle the murder of the princes but we don't have any parallel crime in our history that I could have compared it to.So unless you are a British history buff I would give this one a pass."
418,2,People like this book?,"Well written, but boring and containing bad conclusions. The whole story hinges on a laid-up detective thinking a painting of someone's face makes him look innocent of murder. What!? Come on! Give me Agatha Christie."
419,3,Interesting Food For Thought!,"As an early modern historian, well, a student of history, I have to give this book only 3 stars. But as a reader, I give it five stars. My first year of university was dominated by studies of The Wars of the Roses and Richard III - in English and History. A friend gave me a copy of Ms. Tey's book and it got me thinking about the bad rap Richard III has got. I have since delved deeper into the mystery, at least as far as the resources of the University of Western Australia's library will allow, (and this is a lot as it has a fantastic collection of History resources), and have decided that Richard III wasn't AS bad as he is made out to be. The Daughter of Time is an entertaining and thought provoking fiction. I reccommend it for all amatuer historians out there. It opens your eyes to the bias of history."
420,5,Five Stars: Not Sufficient,"I read ""The Daughter of Time"" as an adolescent, joined the Richard III Society in my twenties, wandered around Bosworth Field at thirty. Found Derek Jacobi's recording at a book sale last year and have listened to it many times since. Hearing a well-narrated book that you previously embraced while reading it is a unique pleasure. The opposite of loving a book, hating the movie. I am sorry that Derek Jacobi recorded no other Inspector Grant than this single book. His Inspector Grant is much different that Stephen Thorne's - they could never be mistaken for each other, and Stephen Thorne's is also brilliant."
421,3,Not really a novel,"This isn't much of a novel: the author's characters are flat and interchangeable; they pale to the point of invisibility beside the information provided about Richard III. Richard is the reason to read the book--forget about its being a novel, and just read it as a document exploring the history of Richard III and the other possible interpretations of the historical records of the king's reign. Just don't expect to care about anyone in the book other than Richard III, or to have to follow a plot: there's none of that here. But, it's still worth reading if you're a history buff--and especially one interested in Richard III."
422,3,Richard iii,Interesting historical review of the nasty legend associated with Richard. Told through the eyes of a recuperating detective in hospital. A bit complex in some places. Overall succeeds well in rehabilitating Richard.
423,5,"Josephine Tey, The Daughter of Time","Don't know how I missed Josephine Tey all these years. This is a very unusual, well written mystery. Very definitely a work of its time, as Adam Grant is a detective of his time and place. But well worth the read."
424,5,???,"I am not a particular fan of the history of the British Monarchy or of mysteries, but ""Daughter of Time"" is an intensely intellectual read, albeit fiction. This is not a story for the passive reader, as it randomly visits different points in time, both ""present"" and past and invokes a series of questions which are ultimatley never answered. The most intiguing element is the supposition that history's account of King Richard III is flawed, either by purposeful acts of those who opposed him, or by mere consequence of events. ""Daughter of Time"" is quite difficult to follow at times and is best read when one is fully alert; a nice pot of hot tea or coffee will help. Not recommended for junior readers unless mystery is their forte'; the story is severely lacking in action although the tale is quite adventurous. See if you can unravel the mystery, if at all possible, then read ""Spring Moon"" by Bette Bao-Lord for a refreshing look at the opposite end of the world/political spectrum."
425,3,"The book is enjoyable, but overrated.","I read the book recently for the second time for my mystery discussion group and was hoping to find it better the second time around but it was not. The characters were enjoyable but the story was not as earth shattering as the book's reputation leads you to believe. I will be trying another book by this author because I did enjoy her style. Can someone tell me why its called ""The Daughter of Time""?"
426,4,"Witty, dynamic and uncomplicated","Dynamic and uncomplicated story that keeps unraveling with the speed of an avalanche.Set in an unexpected surroundings (a hospital), the story evolves around the investigationand subsequent discovery of the true reason behind the murders of the Two Princes in 1483.The writing style is engaging, full of interesting fact and witty comedic nuances that make one oblivious to the time it takes to finish the book. The author gets to the heart of matter without painting unnecessary surroundings. It's a well-written, entertaining book and I recommend it if you have an afternoon to kill.by Simon Cleveland"
427,3,Coincidence of Recent Events,"This is a ""mystery"" story that involves debunking the bad reputation of King Richard III of England. The writing, the set-up, and the characters are awkward and not believable. But the ""evidence"" that King Richard III has been unfairly maligned through history--especially by Thomas More and William Shakespeare--becomes compelling in spite of the serious shortcomings of the novel. The recent discovery of what some consider to be the remains of the real Richard III makes this story much more interesting than it would be otherwise. I found myself delving into English history and researching the Richard III Society, the members of which have been arguing that Richard deserves to be rehabilitated. For that reason alone, the novel is worth reading."
428,5,A Milestone in detective and historical fiction,"This is one of the 2 or 3 must reads in the entire history of detective fiction. It's also the book that was most responsible for popularizing the revisionist narrative of the life of Richard III. And it's an insightful study into the way history is recorded to suit the interests and prejudices of historians, including the ""sainted Thomas More,"" who is taken to the woodshed."
429,5,Superb writing.,I had only marginal interest in Richard III before but the book was so compelling that you are drawn into the search for how and why Richard got his reputation and now I am a fan of both Josephine Tey (the late) and Richard. Unusual detective story but the characters were so well differentiated that you will read it again.
430,3,One of the best mysteries??/,"This novel is apparently well-loved but although it's clever, it's certainly not great. First, unless you're a fan of British history, you'll hate this novel. If you like action mysteries, you'll hate this novel. It's an intellectual's mystery and Tey is a good writer but this novel is not her best."
431,4,Daughter of Time,I ordered two copies of the Daughter of Time for gifts. They arrived promptly and were in good condition.
432,4,Wish I knew more about British history,"I think readers who are more knowledgeable in British history will have even more fun reading this book. Although I am confuse by all the Richards, Edwards and Elizabeths and the lords and the ladies, I still think this is a wonderful story. The case is convincingly presented. I even had a vivid dream in which I was arguing for Richard III's innoncence!"
433,3,"A good book, but you need to know some English history","An enjoyable book, but I'm sure I would have liked it even more if I had a working knowledge of English history. The story is based around solving a mystery of 2 murders attributed to Richard III. It is an easy and engaging read."
434,5,"Daughter of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme","Couldn't resist the Simon & Garfunkel reference.This is easily one of the best mysteries I have ever read, and believe me I do a lot of reading. While admittedly it sometimes gets a little difficult to follow at times, I found the whole premise so different and intriguing from other mysteries I have read that it kept me going. My first thought was it is surprising that other authors haven't really tried to duplicate this type of story, but I think anything would come up short. It's like hollywood trying to remake classics or follow the same storyline (it never works). There is only one ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and there is only one ""Daughter of Time"". I am looking forward to reading another Tey novel."
435,1,Historically inacurate and boring to boot.,"I found this book to be one of the most historically inacurate books on the Wars of the Roses ever written. Tey uses the shield of ""historical fiction"" and writes as a dabbler in the history of the period; without a serious consideration of the key players. She maligns the good reputation of Sir Thomas More, and makes ridiculous assumptions about his motives that do not stand up to close academic scrutiny. In addition she bases her detectives entire investigation on a portrait that is totally unauthenticated. I found her dismissal of Historians offensive and her overall lack of scholarship depressing. Read this book if you must, but then go out and get Alison Weir's ""The Princes in the Tower"" for a more accurate view of the period."
436,1,"Face it, he killed them.","The pro-Richard effluvium is getting rather overwhelming here, so for all of you who think this is actually a history book, I'll recommend another book by a real scholar: The Princes in the Tower, by Alison Weir."
437,1,One of the most overrated mystery classics,"I had great difficulties through the years reading this book. After finally reading it from cover to cover, my opinion had not improved: its chief virtue is length (mercifully short). It is mostly boring and of interest chiefly to students of the famous Tower of London murders it ""analyzes"". This book owes its reputation chiefly to the rave review that the greatest of all mystery genre reviewers, the late Anthony Boucher, gave it. For once, I dissented greatly."
438,2,Histories and mysteries do not mix.,The most overrated book in the mystery genre is this attempt to fuse the mystery genre with the history genre. The mixture does not work. And Tey's conclusions are very out of date by now.
439,1,"Don't Get It, Don't Care","Almost one-half way through this so-called mystery, I had to put it down. Perhaps you had to be British to care about whether Richard III killed his nephews. There seems to be more engaging historical mysteries. And what about the use of research as a device to tell a mystery tale? It simply did not work. Perhaps she could have written a history book instead? I didn't get it. Also, I doubt if I will read anything else by Tey."
440,1,Slow reading...,"This book was a required summer reading book. It seemed like it took me the entire summer to finish it. It took a very long time to get through it, and I was confused at many times during the novel. Not recommended unless you're up for a challenge."
441,1,Boring!,"This book is the most boring book that I ever read. I mean, all we see is this guy who has a broken leg, and who's trying to solve a mystery that occurs decades ago. What's the point?"
442,3,Patience is a Virtue,"Patience is a virtue. And you'll need quite a large amount of it if you're to read this book. For the first 50 or so pages, the story is rather slow a majority of the time. True, they do have their interesting bits, but they are short and few. However, after the first 50 or so pages...if you're a history buff, you're in for quite a ride! Ms Tey explores every aspect of Richard III's case for and against him in the murder of his two nephews. Her reccuring theme of the fallibility of evidence and the persecution of innocence is strongly present in this novel. Includes a rather ""quirky"" ending that the less ""straightforward"" readers will quite enjoy."
443,5,an excellent blast of the past,a different approach to what might have happend in the castle when richard III ruled england.you will become your own detective and come to your own conclusions. I looked for more books on richard III ever since josephine tey introduced me to him. Thank you J.T....
444,3,Painfully dull.,"I'm a Ricardian. I don't think Richard did his nephews in. Neither do I think that this book is a classic. It has a rather simple premise, and Tey seems completely set upon raising Richard III to a sort of divine pedestal. The guy had flaws. He was responsible for beheading people, and was a king. He is one of my favorite characters in history, and Tey tries, she does...but it falls flat. Carradine got on my nerves as well. Sorry.If you want an admittedly romanticized (but far more interesting) book about Richard III, I would wholeheartedly suggest ""The Sunne in Splendour"". It is a finely crafted novel in which Sharon Kay Penman goes to show you that it is indeed very possible that Richard III was not the brute Will Shakespeare makes him out to be. Penman stays well within the historical boundaries (her reasearch is almost without boundaries)."
445,4,Fiction?,"This book was recommended to me during a family discussion on whether or not Richard III was guilty of killing his two nephews. I expected this book to be a biography, but it is presented in a fiction form of an inspector and a student looking into the mystery of Richard III while the inspector was bedridden. The dialogue in the book is between the inspector and the student, who is doing the research at the British Museum. The student then brings the research information back to the bedridden inspector. There are some good points made in the book which casts doubt on the general history's portrait of Richard III as the evil uncle. Although the book is well written and make interesting points, I cannot help be wonder whether or not the information is fiction because of the way Tey presented the story. Tey shows alternate theories of what may have happened to the Princes in the Tower."
446,1,Bored to tears,This book has to be the worst book.... other than Shakespeare.... that i have ever read in my high school career. It goes on and on about a murder that really doesn't matter and the guy doesn't even get out of bed.
447,5,The Not-so-sainted Thomas More,"The format of a ""whodunnit"" is admirably suited to Josephine Tey's critical look at the reign of Richard III, the ambition of Henry VII, and the fact that it's the winner who writes the history that comes to be accepted as fact, whether or not it is, indeed, factual. This book is an excellent companion-read to Thomas More's ""History of Richard III"", puts a new term into my working vocabulary (""Tonypandy""), and shows Thomas More to have more(pun intended) of an interest in his future employment under Henry VII than he did of his life under Henry VIII. Too bad the image of Richard III on the cover is not the image described in the book; it would have been better to not put a new cover on this edition -- and that's my only objection."
448,1,Total Crap,"I bought this CD player with a gift certificate I got for Christmas. First of all it ways about 10 pounds, and it only comes with only 3 secound anti-shock""which they don't tell you in the review or on the web site"". I didn't even use it as soon as I opended the box and saw how big it was I repacked it and sent it back."
449,5,Great Product,"It is a wonderful product, not greasy andleaves the skin feeling smooth.lt does all that itsays it should do."
450,2,REVISE YOUR RETURN POLICY.,Product was small to size. Return policy sucks so I kept it. Perhaps I can pass it on to someone else......
451,5,The Best,"I gave these silk Pajamas to my dad for his birthday. He told me "" He never felt anything so wonderful in his life"". They are without a question the best pajamas in the world!"
452,1,I Wont do it again,I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policyI made a mistake by buying it
453,2,"Lovely, but POOR color quality","These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore. the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!!"
454,5,Very Peased,The pajamas are an excellent quality of silk although I have to admit I have not washed them yet. They ironed easily and look great on my husband. I was impressed with the workmanship and detailed sewing. The 2X I ordered was ample considering at 6'3' and 225 pounds they fit. He is not broad in the shoulders so that problem was solved by having the cuffs shortened. My husband is comfortable in them and that is what counts.
455,5,ut,didn't belive i would enjoy the cool comfort. usually i tend to sweat when wearing cotten but the silk was cooler
456,4,Good quality,This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount. Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though.
457,1,Looks good but material tears easily,Got these for Christmas from my wife. They looked great but it's February and the crotch is already completely torn out of them. Just turning over in bed is more than the material can handle. I do NOT recommend these.
458,1,Ripped off.,"I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband's birthday. Within a week, all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs. I paid $160 dollars for these pajamas, more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon, expecting I was buying quality. After a week's use, they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded."
459,3,quality of silk--okay- but not for the money,"The pajamas were way too expensive for the money. I thought I was getting a real velvety soft heavy silk. The silk was actually rough and sort of stiff. I like the sizing and the color is very nice, but I think they are overpriced."
460,3,comfortable but may not last too long,My boyfriend loves these but they already have a bit of a hole forming in the crotch area and he's just been wearing them for a couple weeks.
461,5,Sensational silk!,"I bought these silk pajamas for my husband for our anniversary, and he LOVED them. They're exactly as described - cool when it's warm out, and warm when it's cool out. He wears them all the time and says they're very comfortable."
462,2,wrong item,"Ordered this for my wife's birthday. was disappointed as the container was totally different. i ordered COTY VANILLA FIELDS COLOGNE SPRAY FOR WOMEN, 1 Once... was shipped ""VANILLA FIELDS BY COTY COLOGNE SPRAY 1 Oz"". In other words same product different container and slightly less expensive, although we were charged the full amount. Not enough difference to go thru the hassle of returning it.."
463,1,Bait and switch at its worst,"The product I received in no way resembles the Vanilla Fields cologne I've been buying for years. The bottle is not the same, but more important, the fragance is unfamiliar, and malodorous. Caveat emptor."
464,1,"It's not new, it's used","It arrived in an amazon box with cushion. Inside the perfume box was beat up and covered in something sticky. Oh, and about 25% of the perfume was already used."
465,3,Not For Practitioners,"This book is suitable reading for someone reading a course on purchasing. For practitioners looking for real insights into value purchasing, best give this a miss as there are not very much information that is already known."
466,4,Review of iPod,"I bought an Apple iPod Shuffle advertised as ""Brand New"". After I had purchased the item off Amazon, I receive an e-mail from the seller stating that it was not as advertised and is not brand new. I still ordered the item and was happy with it, as it had no scratches, but was a little bummed because I was counting on a brand new one. iPod works great and my niece loves it."
467,2,Paper feed problem,"Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect. I called the HP tech support, but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned. They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett's ingenious solution, this printer is more or less reusable again."
468,1,Paper feed nightmare,"I just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed. Not long after I bought this model (but too late to return)it started having problems with the paper feed. I now have to hand feed each piece of paper, and even then it sometimes doesn't work. The print quality is fine, but what good is it if you can't get the paper in. I now have to replace this ""new"" printer. That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted."
469,1,Not so Photosmart,My experience with HP printers has been good. But this one disappoints me. Find a different model with better reviews. The print quality is good but the paper feed problems are frequent.
470,1,paper feed problems,I had the printer for one month before the paper feed problems occurred. I went to tech support and after they asked me re-register for the THIRD time I threw the printer out the window (literally). No HP for me!
471,1,Hairspray fixes paper feed problem,It's true. The only thing that works in applying hairspray on the rollers with a Q tip (after first applying alcohol with the Q tip and letting it dry). Pathetic!
472,1,yes total waste of money,"This is the second HP printer I bought and frankly the only reason I tried this printer was because of the network connectivity. I haven't written many reviews before, but this product is soo bad that I had to add to the list of angry customers. Getting the printer to load 1 piece of paper is a nightmare. Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine. Anyone see office space? yeah after I get my new Canon printer, i will re-enact that scene. perhaps i should record it and send it to HP?"
473,2,**JUNK***,"Please save yourself some money and if you have this printer..unplug it and throw in trash now before you waste countless hours of your time, ink and expensive paper...jams constantly and hand feeding required..RUN AWAY!!"
474,2,paper feeding problem.. solved..,"Update: 5/8/07I finally contacted HP about the paper feeding problem. I chat with the HP associate online, and it was a plesant chat. He was really nice. After some troubleshooting and the problem still hadn't been solved, he agreed to send a cleaning kit to me for free (as it was covered by the warrenty). The cleaning kit came and it worked. I've been using the printer for a couple of months after the cleaning, and it's working with no problems. So if you encounter the same problem, try contacting HP.Just like other users have commented, this printer doesn't automatically get the paper, so you have to stay ready by the printer to feed each page. It gets very annoying. The reason I gave it a 2 star is because of it's quality of the printouts. Also, the ink is fairly priced."
475,1,Find Another,"I have had good success with HP in the past, but I never had any luck with this printer. Like a lot of the reviews, the paper feed never worked right and I would have to hand feed the pages one at a time. When feeding paper it seemed like the printer jammed half the time. I only tried one scan and an HP error message jumped up. I downloaded the current software, some 165mb and reloaded but never got the scan to work. I went through the supplied ink cartridge quickly and after loading a new cartridge my text prints were coming out with a double image. Luckily I purchased the unit at Sam's Club and they took it right back after 3+ months that I tried to get this unit to work, thinking it was me and not the printer. I would have liked to purchase my next printer from Sam's also, but I am going to try the Canon MP600 and they don't seem to carry it."
476,3,Not so great now that vista is here,"Had this machine for about a year, and honestly can say I haven't had the paper feed issues everyone is complaining aboot. My problem is that, as of today 2/23/2007, there are still no network drivers for Vista available for this machine. Because Microsoft surprised everybody with the out of the blue Vista release. HP's website assures me that all the kings horses and all the kings men are working on this and one will be available soon. In the meantime I should plug it into my USB port so nobody else in my house can print. Now the nearly 330mb install of the XP drivers really galled me when I installed them a year ago, so when the 1gb Windows Vista drivers become available I'll probably screw myself into the ceiling. I'm going to replace with a Brother 440c."
477,1,Paper Feed Issues-AGAIN,"At the risk of repeating everythingeveryone else has already said, pleaseread past reviews.The expense I haveto go through just to get **1** pageto print is absolutely ridicously!I end up going to Kinkos half the time.Deep regrets about this one!"
478,1,Paper jam -- common among HP inkjets,"The printer worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then the paper feed mechanism suddenly stopped picking up the paper. I found that I could print single sheets if I shoved a piece of paper in at just the right moment. Too early and I would get a paper jam, too late and I would get an ""out of paper"" message.This issue afflicts a good number of HP inkjet printers. So many, in fact, that HP created a help page just for it: [...]Customer service is sending out a ""printer cleaning kit"", a.k.a. a mechanical band-aid for whatever design flaw they couldn't fix on schedule."
479,4,Good basic printer,"I'm a college student and use this printer on a pretty regular basis. I've had this printer for about a year and have NEVER had any problems with the paper feed. Maybe it just depends on where they manufactured your printer. Everything I've printed, from Word documents to skydiving pics, has turned out great. I print out all my photos on store brand glossy photo paper (much cheaper) and they look fantastic.Pros: Quick print time, not too noisy, great print quality for documents and photosCons: Plain design, but since you won't be spending all your time looking at it does it really matter?"
480,1,PAPER JAMS,"This printer is awful. I have researched complaints about the 2575 and found tons of consumers with the same paper feed/jam problems. Not only does it take forever getting something printed because of the thing not grabbing the paper, but once it finally decides to feed it chews it up, causing almost half of the pages to be ruined. Great, more money for hp- paper.And how about thier troubleshooting for the issue on the hp website? I feel that hp is aware of the issues, yet their support page lists a few of the common things you should check and if those don't work, they suggest you invest some more of your money in a cleaning kit they sell. That might be ok if you had the thing for a while, but most complaints are from customers who haven't had the thing more than a month.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy it."
481,1,Complete garbage.,"I had just bought this printer in May and it worked fine to begin with, now it's having the same paper jam and out of paper issues as almost all of the other people's printers are on this site..please, avoid this printer at all costs..all it does is give a person a headache trying to fix the problem. The only thing good about this machine is the printing quality, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it is a completely dysfunctional product. Had I read these reviews before purchasing, I would have never invested in this product..the sad thing is, I have previously owned a different HP model and it worked great..too bad this one wasn't the same."
482,1,Awful!,"I've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years. Now they are back! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets. Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4. Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all, but this one does not!"
483,1,Don't buy this printer!,The constant printer jams make this printer unusable! And don't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer's directions. The thing jams with HP's own (expensive) paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray.
484,1,Buyer Beware!,"Wish I had read these reviews before buying this piece of crap. It did great for about 2 weeks, then the paper feed problems began. It doesn't pick up the sheets unless I feed them one at a time. If I don't, the rollers simply don't pick up the paper, and the message reads ""No paper in paper tray"" even though there is plenty. Then the misfeeds and paper jams continue. It even stops and reads ""Paper Jam!!"" when there is no paper jam!I called HP and they sent me a new one free of charge, with a box to return the old one in. The new one worked fine for 2 weeks, then started up again with the same old headaches. The alcohol/hairspray trick another reviewer suggested for the rollers does not work. Save your money. This printer is the absolute worst. HP should be ashamed of themselves for putting it on the market. They MUST have known about the problems."
485,1,"Doesn't scan, doesn't print!","I agree with the others here, HP are useless and I should have known better. Paper jams all the time using laser quality paper kept in a humidity controlled environment. Every copy you have to feed through manually.I couldjust about live with that but it doesn't scan either!! It says it'sscanning, it sounds like it's scanning - it even says image sent to the computer after scanning but do any images appear?? Do they heck!! Still under warranty, I've had a replacement unit and still the same and the HP techie team, (based in India!) can't help - it's going back!!"
486,1,This is the worst printer I've ever seen,"DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!! I was given this as a gift, so thankfully didn't spend any money on it. It simply will not print. I usually spend about half an hour and end up with at least 30 ruined sheets of paper to print one page.In looking online, I can see that other users have had the same problem. Apparently the feed mechanism is faulty.Very faulty.I find my blood pressure rising just looking at the printer.Please buy any printer other than this one. And I'm staying away from HP in the future."
487,2,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I have actually not yet had the paper feed issue like the rest of the reviewers, but this product has been horribly implemented. I have continually had issues with attempting to install the 160+ MB driver and HP Solution Center software on multiple different computers running different Operating Systems. The scanner is about worn out, as it makes a horrible grinding noise when scanning which started to occur within months of the purchase. HP used to be known for their great quality in printers, but this is unfortunately no longer the case. Do Not Buy."
488,1,Babysitting the printer,"Like others I would like to voice my frustration with the paper feed mechanism. It worked fine at first but then it would say that there was no paper in the tray when of course there was lots of it. HP sent me a cleaner for it but it could only be used 3 times. When that option ran out I contacted them again and they stated they could no longer help me with the problem. Disappointing for a large company to put out such a crappy printer and I am definitely going us use reviews the next time I purchase a printer. Not sure if I trust HP anymore. Now I'm getting the ""No Scan Option"" message and it seems to be a fairly common problem also. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!"
489,1,Paper-jam Issues from the Get Go,"Honestly, this printer worked normally for me for a day - the first day I set it up. Since then, I have had to hand feed every single piece of paper I try to print. Then there were the issues of it only printing in color and not using any of the black ink cartridge. The only fix was to replace a virtually new cartridge. Granted, the customer service people at HP, who helped me troubleshoot through instant message, were helpful, but this has been a lemon from the moment I bought it.I don't think I have ever found a printer that is not a professional-office grade one that works well at home. Any suggestions would be most welcome!"
490,1,In the immortal works of Monty Python,"RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.When and if it works, it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue. I guess it's come to the point where we have to beg, plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised. I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $50, so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that ""if they only spend 50 bucks, what did they expect?"" ""They should have paid more so it will work."""
491,2,"Yes, the paper does not feed correctly!","I am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems. The printer was fine at first although difficult to set up (software). Now, a month later, the printer either doesn't take the paper or jams. It has nothing to do with the quality of the paper. I am also surprised that this wasn't discovered in testing. I also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller. What a rip off. I have had it with HP printers. I will never buy another."
492,1,I also have the paper feed problem,"Update... HP sent me a replacement printer at no charge!My printer did the same thing that so many others here have reported... worked fine for a while and then stopped feeding paper. It seems clear to me (after carefully inspecting and poking at it without disassembling it) that the roller that initially feeds the paper doesn't apply enough pressure. I kept thinking something must have broken, but now I think it is just a bad design and HP should do something about this. My plan is to call them, point out the dozens and dozens of complaints on-line and urge them to replace the darn thing with something that works."
493,1,Paper bottom feeder,"After one month, the paper will not lift from the tray. HP knows about this problem when I called service. They showed me how to clean the paper puller wheel. It works for now. A little dust, and the wheel gets no traction. Stay away from this printer."
494,1,worst paper feed ever,"It looks great, lcd screen with media card slots was nice touch..but what good is it if it can't take in any paper to PRINT ANY THING OUT ...I was able to get it to take in paper using exclusive HP paperand ONE PAPER at a time it works SOME TIMES.My first HP printer and it will be my LAST,when I run out of Ink on the darn thing, rather thanburning 60 bucks for INK I would buy a LEXMARK again."
495,3,ALL HP SOFTWARE DRIVERS SEEMS FLAWED...????,This Is An OLD Review and may or may not be valid today:I Now Recommend that when you install the drivers for this machine you select custom installation and deselect all but the drivers then you should have the best results. It requires you sometimes clean the ink resevoir area with distilled water since the old ink builds up there into lumps. The ink seems water soluble so its best to use water and not alcohol to clean up the ink before installing new cartridges. HP like other USA high tech industrial places seem to want too much control so instead of just installing what you really need they try to install everything at once. The internet stuff with this machine was too aggressive and would always cause me troubles until I learned you can install the drivers only but you must select CUSTOM installation right at the start or you are given no choices.But I Still Say there is too much manipulation going on of us ignoramouses.
496,1,Paper,"I use the recommended paper for this machine and after a couple of weeks began noticing a problem with the printing. Everytime I print a page, the machine fails to feed the paper through. I have to manually hold the paper in until the machine can grab it and pull it through to print. It's a waste of time and a waste of money."
497,1,Piece of junk,"Worst printer I've ever bought. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!! Constant Paper Jams, thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting, annoying polling every couple minutes. This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy. I was ripped off for a premium-line printer. I'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I've never had a single problem with it."
498,1,WORST. PRINTER. EVER.,"HP IS TWO-FOR-TWO AT SELLING ME USELESS JUNK. HPs own installation CD couldnt install this piece of junk, and kept telling me there was no printer connected. So I tried installing it with the default Mac OSX printer utility, and it worked fine, printed in color and everything, but it wouldn't scan. So after visiting the HP support site, which led me thru a tedious half hour of searching thru files and deleting over 30 files manually, it then directed me to a page where I could download a new HP driver. THE PAGE DIDNT EXIST. I learned an expensive lesson - NEVER BUY AN HP PRINTER."
499,1,Buyer Beware,"Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies. The fix was to remove ink cartridges, disconnect machine from surge protector, powercycle three or four times, wipe copper connects, put them back in, reconnect to computer, start it all again. It worked. Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines. Got out my copy of troubleshoot, tried it again to no avail, Warranty is expired and I'm told it is a hardware problem. I feel ripped off. Stay away from this HP product."
500,1,"I see ""Out of Paper"" 75% of the time; ""Paper Jam"" 23%",I am ready to throw this one out the window. I just inherited it upon marriage and now I know why the daughter who owned it wanted her own things when she moved out.I am really tired of Out of Paper and Pater Jam notices.I consider myself to be extremely printer competent but this machine has not little tricks for coaxing it to print. It is just junk.
501,3,Great printing...if you can get it to feed paper.,"Much like the others, mine has stopped feeding paper. I have to push each sheet of paper into the machine to get it to work. I'm extremely happy with the printing and scanning abilities of the unit, but the paper feeder is not a good design.There were fewer reviews of this unit when I bought mine, so I thought ""It probably won't happen to me."" Rest assured, if you buy this printer, it will happen to you. Too bad - this is extremely frustrating, as the print quality is great."
502,2,Problems printing in color after about a month of use,"Things I like: wireless printing to Mac and PC, scanning, and copying. My paper never jammed. I bought this printer and used it for about a month before the color stopped working. I called support numerous times and it was a time-consuming endeavor. Each time, we would get the printer working only to have the color stop working a couple of days later. Due to the time it took to work with support and my busy schedule, I was unable to stay on top of it before my warrantee ran out...maybe that is the HP plan? Anyway, not only does the color not work, but if I don't set the documents to ""black only"", it will print blank space where the colors were. Very annoying. I also do not like how HP software installs all sorts of ""helpful"" stuff that pops up all the time. The only way I could see to avoid that was to only install the driver, but then I couldn't use the scanner."
503,1,I will never buy another HP printer,Please do not waste your money. I have had one for 2 years and have reloaded the software to make it work at least 30 times.
504,1,GARBAGE is NOW DEFINED as THIS PRINTER,"PLEASE this is a warning! Do not buy this printer!!! Avoid at all costs!! HP tech support is useless and clueless. I had it for 3 days when it started jamming 100% of the time. PLUS, as a graphic designer I need my output to be tru to scale, this junk prints a 4 inch square as a 4.125 inch square! It does NOTHING good, plus it ran out of color ink after 40 pages!!I wish they had negative 5 stars"
505,1,Would have been great if it only accepted paper,"Add my voice to the throng of unsatisfied customers who own this one. The features are great, the print quality's great, but once the paper stops feeding except manually a sheet at a time (and even then only after several attempts and paper jams), you're hosed. Look elsewhere."
506,1,mine jams too,"It was great at first, but after a few weeks of light duty, it will no longer feed the paper. It keeps saying it is out of paper, but it isn't. If I ""nudge"" the paper with my finger, it will print.Oh well, I should have known better than to give HP another chance."
507,5,"Great product, easy to use","Pictures are clear, colors are great. Easy to operate the scanner/copier. Color cartridges last a very long time, unlike my previous Canon printer."
508,1,Paper feeder stopped working after 2 months,"I bought this printer from Sam's Club, and it worked great for about 2 months. After that, the paper feeder was unable to recognize paper - in order to print anything, the paper had to be manually fed through the printer. Fortunately, Sam's was great and gave me a full refund. Buyer beware!I bought the Canon Pixma MP600 - we'll see how that one works."
509,1,Sorry piece of junk!,"I have had HP printers for years and this is the first one I have ever owned that came out of the box giving problems with paper jams and not feeding paper. If I was Hewlett Packard, I would have recalled this junk or offered to give customers credit for what they paid against another printer. I will never purchase another HP printer. Never!"
510,1,Doesn't deserve any stars...,"This printer fails as a printer mainly because paper won't properly feed. HP helpdesk requests you to tap all paper, and put in 10~25 sheets only. This doesn't work. Feeding one sheet at a time manually has at best a 1/10 shot of success. Let's hope HP's refurb replacement printer is better."
511,1,Very dissatified with this *thing*,"This is the first review I have ever written, but I am so annoyed with this so-called printer that I had to add my 2 cents.My last HP printer lasted for over 5 years before giving up the ghost. I was happy with its preformance. This one I have had about 2 months and I am ready to throw it out the window.The paper feeding problem is VERY ANNOYING. I find I have to fiddle for many minutes to get it to recognize there is paper in the tray. Then once it does, it has a 50/50 chance of jamming!For HP to call it a printer is almost funny, because I have yet to have it just print without problems.I am in the market for a new printer after less than 2 months!"
512,2,HP PhotoSmart 2575 scanner makes noise,"I had a previous model similar to the HP 2575 which lasted for 2 years with alot of use. However, after purchasing this model on Sept 21, 2006 and using it for barely 2 months the scanner mode is now squeaking and sounds horrible. This is the same noise the prior version did right before it quit. I agree that HP support is completely worthless - that's if you can even get them to understand what your problem is since it may not be in their ""manual"".Anyone have a suggestion on a decent brand that will do incredible scans of old photos and not fail in the first two years??"
513,2,Out of Paper,"I have had this printer for about three months and have consistently had the same problems with the printer telling me that it is out of paper when I am looking at a stack of paper. Sometimes it works, more often it does not. It is very inconsistent.Now I have a new issue. The scanner, which is very good, has stopped working. When I press the scan button, my printer says, ""No Scan Options"" which is fantasticAlso, I tried to use some specialty paper (namely iron on paper) in this machine and it was a complete mess. For what I paid, this should not be happening. I thought HP made a good machine, but I will NEVER buy a HP printer again."
514,2,Dissappointing. Started great but the paper feed is a problem.,"I bought this printer from Staples back in January. It was terrific and I really was hoping to take advantage of the scanner, the printer, and the network port. Seemed like a great package. But the paper feed issue is real.I'm using standard printer paper from Staples, nothing fancy. But the printer simply isn't picking the paper up. If I don't do anything the ""Out of Paper"" message appears. I literally have to push the paper in when i'm printing (of course that sometimes causes the printer to jam known as a lose-lose)Also, the software the comes with the printer is dreadful. Scanning is good, but forget about it if you want to copy pictures off a memory card you stuck in the printer.It's too bad, i've never had such a bad HP printer experience either with an inkjet or laser at work. I'm dissappointed."
515,1,"""Out of Paper""","I didn't buy the printer from Amazon. But because I like Amazon and value its readers is my reason for writing this. The HP Photosmart 2575xi that I purchased was a great machine. However, when you discover its little idiosyncrasies it becomes a royal pain in the neck! The paper feed does not work correctly and I am not the only one that has had this problem. It completely destroyed my faith in HP when techs tell you turn it off 3 times and then what? Send it back...............You have to hand feed like a little baby.........then the paper jam error comes up................wonder what HP Tech's go to school for.......to learn to say turn it off 3 times and unplug it for 10 minutes..........then repeat it...sounds like level I techs on the Internet Providers..........Get your act together HP....................."
516,1,piece of junk!,"Don't waste your money. This is the worst printer I have ever owned. If this is an indication of other HP products, no wonder HP stock is tanking. Paper doesn't feed, display screen doesn't work, error light blinks continuously.I'm taking this into the back yard and going ""office Space"" on it."
517,1,This printer is a nightmare!,"It is almost impossible to get this printer to print without an out of paper error, jam, etc. Doesn't matter what kind of paper you use. Whether you put in one piece (still doesn't work), more then one ( takes entire stack) It always says out of paper when it's not. What a nightmare. I'm finally tossing this item. I will NEVER by an HP product again. There are hundreds of complaints about this problem and they won't take the printer back."
518,1,Can't believe I wasted my money,"This worked for about a month, then the scanner function ceased to work except by accessing it through the computer, in other words, you couldn't put a photo in it and push the scan button but had to go thru the computer. Now even that doesn't work. The troubleshooting they have is extremely complicated/pure gibberish.What a piece of junk."
519,3,Worked Well,"Yeah, it worked well for about 2 years of low volume printing (maybe 100 sheets a month). I bought a 2 year extended warranty and right on cue it started vomiting on the 25th month. Actually the ink kept bleeding from the cartridges creating a big mess. I never thought or considered this thing to be a work horse. I wanted it for light printing, and it did the job. Although the print cartridges don't last long and are a bit pricey. I now plan to hook it up to my computer and use the scanner. I never used this machine with my computer, so I am hoping that it'll work out and scan well. I am going to Office Depot tomorrow and buy a Canon D340. It is a nice little work horse... so I heard. By the way, I never had problems with paper jams with this machine- not once."
520,2,inkjet problems,"I have to say I've never had the paper feed problem that everyone else here complains about, and I've had my printer for well over a year. I came here, though, on a google search to try to find out why the color inkjet just never NEVER works. I don't use this often, but I was excited to have a color printer. I think the only decent color picture I made with this printer may have been the first one. Since then I've replaced the inkjets (expensive!), and clean them repeatedly just to get them to print, but they're always stripey, making the color printer (especially for photographs) essentially useless, making me wish I'd sprung a few extra bucks for a printer that might have worked better.As for b&w; printing, scanning, and copying, I've had no problems."
521,1,Stay Away!!!,This COULD be a great printer except for the paper handling mentioned before. I will never purchase another HP printer.
522,2,Very disappointed,"I can't believe all the problems with feeding the paper. Glad (well not glad) to see I am not alone. I've tried every and anything to get my paper to feed. If I knew then what I know now, I would have returned the piece of junk. It's too late now."
523,2,Paper Jam Issues,"It's all true about the paper jam issues. After a while, you need to manually load each piece of paper for it to pick it up. Once the paper is fed, it prints fine. It's getting the paper to feed that's the issue. It's very frustrating!! Next time I'm buying a different brand!"
524,1,Does this work or not?,"This item has a number of issues, admitted on the site of HP and other forums.They vary from paper feed issues, to connection and hardware conflicts.I have experienced the printer working without problems for 3 months then suddenly with no hardward or software changes the printer stopped.I got it working again for a short period however there appears to be faults in the actual software from HP.If you want a hassle free printer that is reliable don't buy this one.When it works it is very impressive but when it goes wrong, you'll be regretting the day you brought it.Im sure there are plently of people that have this printer and have had no problems at all, however if you do your research there are an awful number of people that do have problems with it.Make your own mind up but check other sites/forums for reviews as well as here."
525,2,Not satisfied,"I wouldn't buy this printer again. I have had it about 2 years. I get paper jams but that's not the worse thing. The ""OK"" button stopped working. So when I get a paper jam, I have to shut the printer off and then back on. Also when I put new print cartridges in, I can't use the OK button so I have the message on the LCD to ""Align the cartridge"".It does print nice pictures.Anyway, I have had several HP printers, they are usually great products. This is the worse printer I have ever had."
526,1,Bane Of My Existence,"Worst. Piece. Of. Equipment. EVER. Oh, how I wish I were exaggerating. After reading many other reviews stating the same problem I've been having (paper jam, out of paper) I can now justify the purchase of a new printer but not before I take great pleasure in placing this one carefully under the front tire of my car, running over it again and again, then packing the thousands of pieces into a box and sending it to HP."
527,1,Multimalfunction Printer,"Printer worked well for about 2 months with light duty printing. Now get constant ""Out of Paper"" errors even though the papertray is full. I've done everything suggested-cleaning roller, etc. After cleaning roller the printer will feed paper for about 5 sheets and then fail again. HP support site says contact them for free cleaning kit. When I contacted then on Online Help site, after a bit of useless troubleshooting, I was told that the printer was out of warranty and cleaning kit would cost $39. I estimate that I printed less than 100 pages of text with this pinter. Since I screwed up and bought extra print cartridges, my cost per page is probably around $2 per sheet. If you own this printer and are planning on upgrading to Vista-beware. There is a good chance the HP Solution Center will have problems."
528,1,bad printer,"It does nice job of printing after you fight to get it to pick up paper, or it jams. Did the call HP right after buying it and they were really no help, clean rollors or some other thing you should not do with a new printer. bought there best brand of HP paper, that did not help.So I give up and will call this a total waste of money and am looking to buy a different printer, also This is just me but trying to get the drivers installed was a big pain."
529,1,anyone see office space?,"undoubtedly the worst piece of equipment i have ever owned. literally threw it into the street less then twenty minutes ago. the only enjoyable experience was heaving it fifteen feet into the air and watching it splatter in the driveway.paper jams, ink problems and general misery all around.would give this a negative 5 stars if i could."
530,2,Kit to fix the problem is not that available easily,"I tried online 'live'support and asked for the kit to fix the ""out of paper"" problem, but they put me through a bunch of questions about it that took so long that I ran out of time. It does not seem to be as simple as contacting them and having them send out a kit."
531,1,Beware!,Great photos if you can get the paper to load. Paper jam after paper jam. Scanned images below average quality. Copies below average quality. Buyer beware!
532,1,Same Paper Feed Problems as Everyone Else,Every time I print ... OUT OF PAPER!! PAPER JAM!! OUT OF PAPER!!! PAPER JAM!!! SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH.this is the sorriest piece of junk i have ever had the misfortune to purchase. i will never buy an HP printer ever again.
533,1,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"I bought this movie new, but it will not play on my DvD player. I have tried several other players/machine to play this in & it will not work in any of them. I am very disappointed with this product. When I was looking at it on Amazon, it didn't say it was not compatable with any system."
534,3,Funny,this is a classic. it's really funny and the way they combined cartoons with people believably was really cool. You should see it
535,1,Sold a bad product,The DVD was used and revealed and was broken and would not play which was very displeasing. They did rerun the item but never shipped me a working DVD
536,1,very dissatisfied,"I ordered this video for my granddaughter, all of the movies i have ordered from Amazon I never knew that you could not view them if they were from region 2. I guess I have been just lucky when odering videos. I never knew about this region 2. I was so upset that I didn't even want to return the video. You people should only sell videos that are able to be watched on all dvd players it was a waste of my time and money. I am not sure if I will buy videos from amazon again or not and I was a very faithful customer."
537,4,"Great for cartoon fanatics, otherwise............","Yep, I'm a cartoon fanatic. Especially of the era depicted here and of the Hanna-Barbera/Filmation/Rankin Bass of my own era and the Simpsons.What that said, this film has a lot for the cartoon lover. Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse actually in the same scene? A comic duel between Donald and Daffy Duck? Looney Tunes meets the Disney crew? This is an animationphile's dream come true!However, the character of Roger is WAY too silly, stupid, and lacking in appeal for me. Imagine Jerry Lewis as a cartoon rabbit and you get the idea. A bit overdone in that aspect. But the business with Jessica Rabbit is amusing as well as the Robert Hoskins character (who interacts quite well with the cartoons-no mean feat for an actor).Overall, it has it's moments (cartoon freaks will LOVE the ending), but not the kind of thing I want to watch more than twice."
538,1,An Awful DVD of an incredible movie,"This is one of my favorite movies ever; there's not a moment that I don't believe that toons and humans are interacting...but this version is a censored version of the film. They cut parts without the consent of the director, and for this reason, I beg you not to buy this version. Wait until they correct the bowdlerization of this masterpiece"
539,2,"Top film, very poor DVD","I have loved this film ever since it was first made, but this DVD really does not do it justice.Despite being called a 'special edition', it contains not a single extra feature. The widescreen format is not anamorphic, which means that the MPEG aspect ratio is 4:3 and the picture resolution of the viewable area is lower than it should be. The quality of the film print used is poor and contains scratches and white speckling. The film has also had some bits edited out, so I suppose you could say it contains a negative number of special features: i.e. some normal features taken out. This is a shocking misuse of the format because the DVD standard contains the possibility for having optional scenes which can be shielded from young viewers, so why wasn't this used?I doubt it will be long before the next version comes out, the 'collector's special edition' or whatever they will call it, so my advice would be to wait for that."
540,1,"One star for the Movie, None for the DVD","As other reviewers have noted, this is a ground-breaking, hilarious, one-of-a-kind movie. It deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection, even if your collection consists of but two DVDs. It deserves five, even six, stars, but...I urge you to wait for another DVD version, for two reasons: first, if ever a film deserved extras, it's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, but we get none on this over-priced DVD. Second, the movie is trimmed by a scant few seconds (on grounds of poor taste in the offending scenes), but the critical thing is -- It IS censored. Strike a small blow for the ability to decide for yourself, and avoid this DVD. Wait -- it'll show up in an unadulterated version at some point in the near future."
541,1,Beware - censored version of movie!,"Caveat emptor -- this DVD release contains a censored version of the movie, different from the previous Laserdisc and VHS releases. It was apparently altered without the director's approval."
542,4,Thank you!!!,I am a huge fan of Roger Rabbit! It was great ordering products from this company. Not only did I get it in one piece but it still had all the origional stuff inside. I will definately order from this company again.. Thank you!!!
543,1,"Great film, but the DVD is attrocious","Let me just get this straight: I love ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". If this DVD had a good transfer, good extras, and uncensored, I would have gone for it's purchase and give it a 5.The problem is, this DVD is the opposite on what I would have gone for.The transfer is a botch job with blurs, sandy in the tan areas, overbright in reds, has a grimmy sound transfer, and IS censored in two parts.Are there any extras? No. Unlike what the lying eyes of the box says, no. And the film is only 14 years old. It deserves extras, at least a theatrical trailer and pencil test.I'd wait for a special edition."
544,1,does not work,This format does not work on ps3 or Xbox 360 so I was unable to view it. I tried to ask for a refund with no response. It is the European format. They need to state it better when it is like that.
545,5,Roger Rabbit,"Great flick...!Only issue is that I live in North America, the DVD did not run on my Bose System...I had to return it."
546,5,Still a lot of fun!,"Not too many family movies stand the test of time...this is one of them! A bit too intense for little kids, but my 7 and 10 year old girls love it. We were watching with their grandfather who got a big kick out of it, too. Christoper Lloyd is a terrific villian and there are plot twists worthy of an adult murder mystery. And where else can you see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny sharing the screen?"
547,5,Incredible !!,"Not only is Jessica the sexiest woman ever, the movie actually gives a little insite to life in Los Angeles during the time before the freeway system we all know. Most people didnt know LA actually did have a great mass transit system at one time so even though this movie pokes fun at a lot of things it is based on some truths. the coupling of Disney and Warner Bros cartoons was also a first, Mickey and Bugs in the same scene. and did I mention Jessica?"
548,5,That rabit is the greatest.,One of my favorites. I recommend it to anyone with kids. Mine is autistic and he loves it. One of his favorites.
549,3,Couldnt play,Its a region 1 so I couldnt play it on my ps3! I noticed later since I didnt know what it was.
550,1,Gouging,"Why on God's green earth is this DVD ""offered"" for $50? It's crazy. Please consider not buying this to send a message about gouging."
551,1,no,Why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in The United States? Does it make any sense for you? Why don't ask us to be sure before send it to another Country? If you know that it won't work on that Country?
552,1,Watch out when purchasing DVD's shipped within the USA but not able to be viewed in the USA because wrong region!?,"I was very disappointed when my DVD arrived and I was unable to view it because I live in the wrong region. Much to my surprise DVD's are specific to certain regions and our DVD players will not allow them to play. I purchased it from Amazon and it said it was coming from North Carolina so why would I suspect that I would not be able to watch it. In fact, until this incident I was totally unaware of such a thing and I feel that consumers should be informed about this. So you are warned! I will however mention that the company Amazon arranged my purchase through refunded my money but my time was wasted."
553,1,Sucked,"I am sorry, but this film was as creative as a pile of toothpaste on a sidewalk on a hot summer day in Phoenix. The active was sub par and the animation was done by interns.The highlight of the film as the bus that was heading for Sunset BLVD.Please, for the love of God, don't let your kids watch this film."
554,4,Two Highways,This movie is a timeless classic. Jessica Rabbit is still one of the hottest actress in cinama to this day. Excluding Alyson Hannigan and Linda Cardellini. Christopher Lloyde shows he has true gritt.
555,5,Toon-riffic!,"This is a DVD you should own if you enjoyed this movie that came out nearly 20 years ago! It offers you the inside story on the behind the scenes production and the animation. It was too bad they didn't make a sequel for Roger Rabbit! Bob Hoskins was wonderful in this film. Still,its good entertainment for everyone!"
556,3,Great film...bad DVD,"The content of the 1988 film is not at question here. Its blend of live action and animation in unprecedented to this day. (Space Jam? P-P-P-Please!) While the plot itself is choppy and cliche, the acting and animation direction (by animation great Richard Willaims) makes it a great film.The DVD has much to be desired with no film notes, director's commentary, nor trailers. I was especially hoping to see the deleted scene in which Eddie Valiant breaks into Jessica's dressing room only to get knocked out by the bouncer and has an early dreadful encounter with Toontown that has only been shown once on a CBS airing of the film. Animation has been edited and redone in several places. Disney really needs to realize that they truly have a film gem here and stop placing it in the back burners of their achievements. Its truly more innovative than anything they've done in recent years before they fell into formula and saccharine characterization."
557,3,Only plays on my MacBook...,"This disk is formatted in some sort of way in which it will not play on ""american"" dvd players. Wasn't aware of that fact when I purchased it but being that I am at least able to view it on my MacBook, and it is still a good quality disk, I'll hang on to it! It is one of my childhood favs after all!"
558,3,"Hey, 'who EDITED Roger Rabbit'?","One of the film's most adult moments with Jessica Rabbit has been cut up and out by Eisner's Disney in the battle to make empty uncontroversial familial fluff. It was a shocking scene and made you take the film more seriously... not anymore. I could see them taking it out of the kid's version if they mentioned it, but the Enthusiast's disc being edited? Thanks a lot Disney. Learn not to play with scissors... or history.I appreciate getting FULL and WIDE screen in one package. They should have given all of the deleted scenes in this, and brought back the original frames and full scenes, like customers expect. It's been like this since the VHS release...Extras should not have been crammed onto one disc.Anyway, beyond that, this is a Great DVD with fine extras. You may want to wait for a better edition with all deleted scenes..."
559,3,Still searching for the trailer,"As you probably know, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a great movie. Unfortunately, the DVD version offers ZERO extras. No cut scenes. No feature commentary. No 'making of' featurette. And NO trailer (the back cover clearly states that the trailer is on the disc)! Isn't there some kind of law against such blatant false advertising? The picture and sound quality are good, but owners of DVD players deserve more than just a bare-bones copy of the movie, especially when it's a cinematic/special effects achievement of this caliber."
560,3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The special effects are nifty and I guess the Chinatown-esque plot is kinda fun, but the gimmick ran stale for me after the first half hour and I wanted a bit more to fall back on than Hoskins' growling and Christopher Lloyd's scenery chewing; I can see why everyone else loves it, but I was not especially enthused."
561,3,Roger rabbit,Movie is great my son loved it but there is 10 minutes or so where the image is very bad.
562,5,Classic movie/Somewhat not for kids/An All Time Favorite.,"Ok this is THEE best version of this movie. The extras are amazing and you get a behind look on how exactly they made everything.This movie isnt/kinda/ not for kids.Its really adult like humor and also child humor. I suggest parents watching it before they let thier kids watching it.BUT!, if you yourself havenst seen this movie yet... YOUR CRAZY! and you dont know what your missing. I bought this movie just cause its a classic and the extras. And it was a very good desicion. BUY IT!"
563,4,One of the greatest,"Great movie. You can tell that the movie filmed doesn't support the HD quality so I wouldn't bother with the HD unless your player only allows it.5 stars for the movie, 2.5 stars for being in HD."
564,4,Crest Multi Spinbrush,This is a good toothbrush! It's much better than a manual toothbrush. My Sonicare broke and while I was replacing it I went back to using the Crest spinbrush. It brushed my teeth well. It did not hurt my gums or my sensitive teeth. It stimulates and cleans my gums and gets my whole mouth clean. I make sure and use a good sensitive toothpaste and it works well. My last dental cleaning went well and all I had been using was the spinbrush. I use my rinses and floss daily but I think the spinbrush did most of the work. I wish it had a little timer on it. I have to guess how long to brush. You do have to replace the batteries kind of often and changing the brush heads is kind of difficult.
565,4,Excellent Product,So far so good! This toothbrush is just as good. My last toothbrush lasted for 5 years and is still working well.
566,5,Live Changing Film,"Living outside of San Antonio and having friends involved in this project, I remember these kids being here and having prayed for them. I was not expecting to ever see the inside of the stories unfold. My heart is changed forever. Watching the anguish and the joy of these families who are trusting that these Americans are going to heal their children is overwhelming. The beautiful hospitality of the people who opened their homes to these families was deeply inspiring. Their faith in Christ is shown in this remarkable way that leads these Buddhist families to trust in Jesus Christ and to trust and thank Him. I cannot recommend this to you enough. Please watch it. Be challenged from your complacency and moved to heal the broken hearted. Be warned. If you are a parent, this will make you want to go to your children and embrace them.This dvd was graciously provided by Thomas Nelson Publishers for review."
567,3,Not quite what I expected,"I ordered this doll based on all the reviews of the Corolle dolls. I bought this one because it laughs and says mama and papa. BUT, the voice is so annoying and mechanical sounding and when it laughs it sounds kind of evil. I'm keeping the doll because the price was right and it is cute."
568,3,Just okay...,"I bought this book with the intention of developing a solid ""base"" understanding in ancient Egyptian history. In that respect, I was, for the most part, disappointed. If you already have a basic understanding of the topic, this is a good book for a quick ""review"", but it's a bit stuffy for the lay-person just starting out. It's short on excitement, long on the dry facts. I like to feel like an ""armchair Indiana Jones"" when I read history books, and this book didn't much convey that feeling to me."
569,2,Egypt in Pictures,"The Egyptians (Ancient Peoples and Places) only as a reference on using pictures and drawings. It was almost as if Cyril didn't care to put any effort into the book, just slap down all the history he could find. He skipped over many things and put down basics. Yet it is a good guide for basic knowledge on monuments, kings, and a good place to find ancient cities of Egypt."
570,3,Adequate at Best,"Pros: Attractive color pretty much as described and fit my very old chairs.Cons: The material is not very sturdy. The cloth pockets where the butterfly chair iron inserts into the cover are not double thickness so I expect these will not hold up very well. I weigh 145 pounds and when I sat down in the chair, the cover stretched and sagged."
571,1,So this is the new doom metal?,"Whatever. The only one demonstrating the slightest amount of talent is the singer, who used to be in O.L.D along with bass player Plotkin. They should have stuck to what they knew. The singing/shrieking is best described as excrutiating, but the music has no redeeming features. I've nothing against detuning but detuning this far just makes the guitar sound poorly tuned and badly played. To me it's extreme for extreme's sake, like making it sound plain crap was their primary objective. Mission accomplished, 2/10."
572,1,bootleg,"This is a bootleg. There are legal releases with much better sound quality. Buy Grooving Kingston 12 (Hip-O Records), Completer Wailers parts 2 and 3 (JAD Records) or African Herbsman (Trojan Records) instead."
573,4,Science based drama,"Race to Mars is hard to categorize, but I would describe it as a science based drama.It presents a scenario in which the most promising ideas and technologies for a successful expedition to Mars are played out."
574,4,I recomend,I loved this realistic (almost a documentary) movie. I liked the way the production joinned together all sort of problems that could be spected by crew. I recomend.
575,4,Shreikback is back,"Naked Apes and Pond Life is the best Shriekback project since Oil and Gold and is far better crafted than Dancing Years or Sacred City. Though Barry Andrews and Martyn Barker are the only two original Shriekers here and Carl Marsh and Dave Andrews are very much missed since bowing out after Oil and Gold, this is an exciting, melodic, deeply textured and multirhythmic return to form, not to be missed by any ardent or casual Shriekback fan. Definitely worth splurging for the import, as it's unlikely it will ever be domestic (and why has their all-time best, Jam Science, never been released on CD? Hello? Is anyone working on this?)."
576,3,"outtakes, yes, but not a bad collection","I agree with Lance Tilford; this is better than Sacred City (or anything post-Oil and Gold, really). Many of these songs have an ""out there"" quality that much of Shriekback's later efforts lacked (like, who thought it was a good idea to cover KC and the Sunshine Band?).Aberrations is better though, and their best albums (Jam Science, Oil and Gold) are much better. BTW Lance, the reason Jam Science hasn't come out on CD is that the band never wanted it released as an LP. Legal disputes between band and label, in other words. At least all of Jam Science's tracks except three (Partyline, Hubris, and the non-remixed Hand on My Heart) are available on various CD compilations."
577,5,Shriekback's Organic - All Natural - High Bran Album,"Shriekback's Barry Andrews is a genius of the highest order. This album has the band ditch all synthesizers (A bold move! Electronics being heretofore their main life-blood.) Andrews' garage sale of the sorts of machines worshiped by pale Englishmen with funny haircuts and their ilk frees him up to add yet another depth to the Shriekback sound. Attempts to express my enthusiasm for works of art like the contents on this CD are ineffable - at least on my part - but I do want to register my 5 stars, and hope that anybody who follows my other recommendations will try this great work of art as well. This is like eavesdropping on Shriekback in a world of no electricity. Thank God somebody was cranking a generator or some such device in order to record this work. AWESOME in the organic, original sense of the word. BUY! BUY! BUY!"
578,5,Gamer Love,"As a Mario fan born in the 80's, this movie is an instant classic in my book. Absolutely loved it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fun to watch, especially if you want to show your kids some of the cool things to come out of your generation."
579,3,GAME:GREAT!MOVIE:OKAY,"The games are the best games ever! The movie was okay, but it had nothing to do with the games! The only things in common are the following characters:Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Daisy(Daisy WAS in the game SUPER MARIO LAND, but nothing else). Toad was in it, too, but I think the way they protreyed him was really retarded! I hated how they screwed up the character! All in all, it was an okay movie, whether or not it was like the game! P.S. They could have at least had something happen to Toad to turn him into the mushroom-like dude."
580,5,Classic,"This move brings back great memories from when I was a kid and everything related to the Mario Bros. rocked! I used to play the video games all the time, I watched the cartoon and to then have a live action movie; it was the cherry on-top. This movie may not have won an major awards, but if you've ever played Mario Bros. on NES you must see this movie. It is well worth the cost to own."
581,5,Flashbacks,"My son had been looking for this old movie for nearly a year. I told him I could probably find it on Amazon.com so I went to look and sure enough, there it was so I ordered it for him. I am not a big Mario Bros fan but my son sure is happy with the movie."
582,3,A fun kids movie...,"""Super Mario Bros."" may have very little to do with the video game of the same name, but it is a lot of fun. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo play Mario and Luigi respectively. They're Brooklyn plumbers who stumble upon a parallel universe containing the evolved versions of dinosaurs. The leader of this new dimension is Koopa, played with charisma by Dennis Hopper. Koopa is in search of a meteorite piece that will merge the two dimensions and allow him to rule the Earth. This is an enjoyable film for the most part, though it has its disappointments, the biggest being that it's almost nothing like the game. But it contains quite a few laughs and good moments that should be a pleasure to kids. While this DVD contains no special features, it makes for a great collectible item."
583,3,Off Key,"For game fans, this movie is not the same. Bob Hoskins is the firm hero who tries to do his best. But the movie can be far off in Left Field. For the movie fan its just a funny way of looking at things.,"
584,2,T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E,"Just stick with the video games, whether they are old or new. This film fails on many levels: it's not as exciting or engaging as a real video game, and it's not as smart or entertaining as any other film. Not even Dennis Hopper can save it. Fans of the original Super Mario Bros. will be definitely disappointed not only because of the lack of excitement, but also the lack of any real connection between the game and the film. As a matter of fact, this doesn't even look like an actual Mario Brothers adaptation (there are many things in this movie that are not connected to the original games). It looks like a completely different fantasy film with just a few elements of the video games added in. I have never actually played Super Mario Bros. and I don't exactly hate this film. But still, the entire movie is flat, dull, and very uninteresting. If you absolutely love Nintendo, then stay away from the Super Mario Bros movie. Nothing in the film works.Grade: D"
585,1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"OK, I'm not going to get into this movie's lack of similarities to the video games;this movie just plain sucks. I can't see why anybody over the age of twelve can enjoy this piece of you know what. Come on, this movie has horrible acting, a dreadfully bad story and ""hilariously"" unfunny jokes. I think you people who gave this movie five stars really need professional help, 'cause one star is far too generous. I'm not saying all the media incarnations of mario sucked;the cartoons were actually pretty good. But this movie, in my opinion is what caused that chain of cartoons to end."
586,1,Terrible with a capital T,"This movie was screwed up all kind of ways.It wasn t even like the video game or even the cartoon.For example,King Kopa didn t look like how he supposed to be and the storyline seem like it was written by a 4 year old.I wonder if the director was on drugs while he was making this so called movie.To all the people that didnt see this movie,you don t need to because you will regret it.Its so bad that it will be perfect to be shown on MST3K."
587,5,Just Recived it,I use to have this film recorded on vidio and recorded over it and was regreting it. I bought it on Dvd. The quality is exellent and it is in widescreen it's a shame there's no Dvd extra's but it's stil a class film one of my all time favourates. It's based on the video game about Mario and Luigi tryinhg to save Princess Daisy from another dimention where diosaurs are still alive and are trying to get back from earth. I'm also glad that yoshi is on it. It reminds me of the game Super Mario World.It's well worth getting for any Mario fan
588,5,awesome movie !!!,"this is a fun movie! fantasitic special effects, fine actingand lots of fun moments make this a must see! The creature effects were outstanding! if you havent seen this special effects extravaganza yet, you got to!!!"
589,4,THIS MOVIE IS DA BOMB BABY!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is rock solid!!! Better than the games... This movie is worth buying so buy it today or else you'll suffer of more cutsie princess movies!
590,1,Worst video game adaption for a move.,Some video game movies are great. Others are horrid. Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1. There is nothing of value in this movie and I strongly suggest that you stay far away unless your looking for something to put yourself to sleep if you have insomnia.
591,1,THIS SUX!!! aviod at all cost!!,"How much did Dennis Hopper get paid to appear in this stinkbomb!! I really respected Dennis Hopper, but after Space Truckers, Im not surprised he made this POS. If you are asking yourself ""this movie can't be THAT bad""...i'm telling you..YES IT CAN!!! It s probably worse that you can even imagine! and what happened to Capt.Lou? all I know is that after this garbage, Bob Hoskin's career went right in the toilet!! WHERE THIS TAPE BELONGS!!PS: no wonder it's out of print...NO ONE WANTED IT!!"
592,1,WORST. MOVIE. EVER.,"This being mario I thought this would be good.I was very, very, very wrong. VERY wrong."
593,3,Fun,This was a cute and fun movie when it came out and it still is. A great movie to watch with the kids or simply enjoy rewatching for the adults.
594,3,Wacky Cult Classic,"Forgetting about how it was ""nothing like the games"" this is actually an ok movie. The best part was the little tiney walking Bob-omb at the end of the movie. It really stole the scene. But if you want to watch a movie about some wacky plumbers who make there way to a dimension with dinosaur creatures...then this is THE only movie you will need to see. It's one of the best vidoe gmae movies out there actually (amongst the horrible: Street Fighter, Tomb Raider, and Mortal Kombat movies)."
595,3,Actually not that bad...,"Well, to start this off, I confess that I am a bad movie officionado. Watching bad movies is my beloved hobby. So when I heard that the Mario Bros. live-action movie had come to DVD, I decided to give it a shot. I bought a copy, popped it into my DVD player and sat back.My first impression was that this Movie would be painful. VERY painful. However, as the film progressed, I realized that the acting was good, the special effects were convincing enough, and the storyline was.....fun. It ain't Braveheart, but there are far worse films, and worse Live-action Video game conversions. At worst, it's watchable. At best, it'll have you laughing."
596,4,A misunderstood and fun film.,"Not much I can say except that this movie is often riffed on for all the wrong reasons.Yes, the movie is indeed flawed in many respects. But at the same time, it has a lot of great set pieces, music, good dialogue, good CG and animatronics, and a a scene using Joe Satroni music.It's just a fun movie, worth riffing on if you hate it, but a fun movie if you appreciate it for exactly what it is supposed to be, a fun ride."
597,3,Super Mario Fans Loved it,"My children - a boy and girl between 5 and 10 - got hooked on Super Mario because of the Wii's Super Mario Galaxy so I bought this movie to surprise them. They loved it and liked to see how Yoshi and the other characters were imagined. They have watched it again and again. Don't get me wrong, it cannot be considered a good movie for adults by any stretch of the imagination but if you watch it with kids and see it through their eyes, it is worth the time investment. Good fun."
598,3,GOOD MOVIE!,IT HAS SOME ACTION.IT'S VERY ADVENTUROUS AND FUN TO WATCH.THE TWO ACTORS PLAY THE PERFECT PART FOR THIS MOVIE.BUY THIS MOVIE.
599,3,"Okay film, needed more game refrences","I think what people really expect when they go to watch this movie is a large video game connection, sadly there is very little. But I have to admit the film was still fun to watch, and for it's time the special effects aren't too bad."
600,3,"not bad, but could have used a little more work","The plot was strange yet interesting, mario and louigi have no powers at all! to do a jump they have to wear special shoes."
601,3,The overall movie was an okay film.,"At the end of the movie when Daisy says you'll never believe this, well why did you leave us hangin what happened did you make another movie? If so why was it never advertised? What going on?"
602,2,Hey Bob Hoskins...what do you think of Super Mario Bros.?,"The following is excerpted from an actual interview with Bob Hoskins, star of Super Mario Bros.:Guardian: ""So, what's the worst job you've done?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""What has been your biggest disappointment?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""If you could edit your past, what would you change?""Hoskins: ""I wouldn't do Super Mario Bros.""Don't mince words, Bob...how did you REALLY feel about Super Mario Bros.?"
603,2,It could have been better...,"I saw this movie last night and was not too impressed. I'm not going to say it wasn't ""realistic,"" it's not meant to be. I mean, jeez, look at the game! I will say that I wish it had more in common with the game... too much was changed, in my opinion. Luigi is a young guy (with no moustache!), Toad is some kind of hippie, and the Goombas are shrunken-head dinos. I suppose most people would expect things to be more similar to the original, just like they'd expect a movie based on a book to be similar. I also got the impression that the writer/director really wasn't familiar with the game, maybe that's why there were so many changes. In any case, it is always tough to take a story from one media to another, and it seems to me that the efforts more often than not fall short of the mark."
604,1,Could have been better!,"I am a big fan of the Super Mario Brothers - the video game and the TV show. I had high hope for this movie, but boy what a waste of time this was. This movie sure give the Super Mario Brothers a bad name. If you haven't seen this movie, I envy you. Nothing like the game of the show. It NEVER should have been made; period."
605,5,An Underappreciated Film,"I liked this movie quite a bit. I felt that it was funny, and the special effects were quite nice. It doens't deserve all the bad reviews it's getting. I highly recommmend it."
606,3,"Amusing, very wierd","I recently saw this movie for the first time, and it is VERY 80s. Full of faces you will recognize, unique to the extreme, very weird, but entertaining."
607,3,This Ain't No Game!,"Let's face facts, the 90s had its weird moments and continual adaptations of games and tv shows was a common trend as much as it is now then. The exception is the adaptations were a lot looser.In this case, SUPER MARIO BROS. makes a unique adjustment in that it stretches the game series into a different world and tone. Given it's been a while since I've seen it after watching it again for the first time in a while, I find that the movie has some fairly decent character moments, but at the same time. I find myself wondering how it is that they mixed all the concepts of the game together and came out with this.It's not the best movie in the world, but it's fun for what it is."
608,3,SUPER MARIO BROS.,"I LIKE THIS MOVIE ALOT!! ITS FUN, FUNNY, AND SO OLD SCHOOL...(WELL LIKE AS OLD SCHOOL AS I CAN GET) ITS GREAT FOR KIDS OR PEOPLE WHO LIKE STUPID FUNNY OR DIG THE NINTENDO ERA!"
609,3,Decent film,"I actually liked this film and found it fairly entertaining. I know some of you are going to go and watch this film because it says mario. Well except for the names, this film has no relation to mario whatsoever. But as general film its pretty entertaining if a bit cheesy and dont expect much depth as the film seems targeted towards young children. So I give it zero stars for mario material and 3 stars for the rest of the film. I recommend renting this film rather than buying it."
610,1,c'mon nintendo,"i'm not gunna lie. this is not a good movie. other game titles would have made a much better story. If they chose kirby, maybe. they could have made a million jokes about a wierd blob and an evil penguin. they could have had action with dark matter in a battle. they should make this movie, instead of more dumb mario movies. Kirby and King Dedede beat Mario and Luigi by a mile."
611,1,All the bad things you heard and then some more.,"There is nothing good I can say about this movie.There is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining about it.If the main-characters didn't go by the names of Mario & Luigi, you'd be lost.Nothing here resembles the video-game it's based on, which isn't a bad thing neccessarily......except that nothing here resembles any kind of story.The acting is bad, perhaps on purpose......but who cares? It's not amusing in the slightest.The movie is boring. In 90 minutes, you'll want to gouge your eyes out.""Super Mario Bros."" -- the movie -- has been proven to damage brain-cells upon each viewing.In a Koopa-shell, don't waste your time on this movie. Don't even look at the cover. Don't even read this review. Just try and pretend this ""movie"" doesn't exist."
612,4,SMB forever,"I know that most people dislike video game movies, especially OLD video game movies, but SMB is just too much fun to pass up. All the characters are hilarious and the special effects are pretty good for such an old movie. The continuity in the plot is well-done as well, its not just a bunch of special effects and gun-shots.I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was seven or eight and loving it. When I saw it on DVD years later I knew I had to buy it, and I STILL laugh the whole time. For someone who grew up through the game revoltion (I still have an original Nintendo system) this movie is as nostaglic as it is funny. I really recommend it."
613,4,Ok - alternate universe. So?,"Why people are absolutely clobbering this movie, I don't know. As a guess, I would say that the title makes you think of the video games, but this is aboslutely *nothing* like the video games, be warned of that from the outset. However if (unlike many others) you can get around the fact that it is completely out of the ordinary for the mario universe, you'll be rewarded to find a great movie with a quite interesting story. I only dock this a star because of the expectations issue. This has no business having ""Mario Bros."" in the title, but otherwise highly recommended :)"
614,3,super mario (good bad cheap as hell),well i seem to see that most peopel witwhe love it or hate it i first saw this on disney channel about 2 - 3 years agothe key with thsi movie is not to care about teh games as muchits got sucky effectsits director problay does drugsand id like to add its aperfect b movie style movieit doenst do teh games justice(but the games have no storyline sav eteh princess)dont get me wrong tehre kick ass gamesbut teh movie has a speacil kind of drunken charm dont knock it till you rented it or stolen it lol
615,3,It pleases me greatly to watch this movie,"I gotta say that though the movie wasn't anything up there in artistic value, it certainly was a good movie to watch. I've been witness to every Super Mario Bros. piece of merchandising and entertainment ever, and seeing the movie and seeing how they related the games and such to a more realistic setting is really intriguing, and right now I'm looking for a good place to buy it."
616,1,Garbage.,"This movie typifies the lazy, expensive, misguided Hollywood misfires of the last 20 years, with its bargain-Blade-Runner-with-more-neon sets, poorly realized characters and jarring tonal shifts. Is it for kids? Is it for adults? A comedy? Thriller? Sci-fi? Who knows! Who cares!?Even if you completely ignore the video game origins (which this movie fouls up miserably), this movie does not work on its own as intelligible entertainment. The movie feels like a poorly directed stage play, with everyone pitching for the last row, but not campy or quotable enough to be memorable.For those of you who think this is an overlooked gem, I direct you to the climax, where Koopa basically stands in the same spot on a walkway for 20 minutes, while clichéd, cartoonish ""action"" unfolds on the same recycled sets around him.Another movie that tries to be everything and only succeeds at being boring and mildly nauseating. Only watch this out of sheer curiosity."
617,3,"Don't bother with the movie, just play the game!","I may be a video game lover, but I love this movie too. This is by far NOT the best video game-based movie, but I enjoyed it. Mostly just to see if I can point out the dumbest, most corny parts of the plot as they come onscreen. I loved (and still do love) the original Super Mario Bros. game for my NES, and this movie is a sort of mockery of it to me. The weak plot and impressive cast just didn't work. It may have a few great stars in it (most namely Bob Hoskins), but even the great actor that he is he couldn't save this movie from ... as bad as it did. A little funny, definately corny, the first time you see it, but it probably won't hold anyone's interest for too long. A better video-game-turned-movie would be Tomb Raider, or Final Fantasy, or The Wizard, but if you like Super Mario, don't disappoint yourself by buying this movie. Just play the game."
618,5,OMG,This is fraken amazingI nearly fillied my daiper when i heard the song=AnesthetizeAmazingly filmed and awesome sound.Best prog Rock DVD I have seencheersKev
619,3,stand still,"I love this band and based on the reviews I could not wait to get this DVD expecailly the Blu-Ray edition. I have to say now I am disappointed. I was basically bored to tears watching these guys. I think Gavin harrison is one of the best drummers out there, but does he ever show any emotion. That goes for all the guys. I guess just have to continue loving there music, but don't plan on going to see them in concert now. I am not looking for a David Lee Roth performance but give me something to show that you are into what you are doing and you realize you are playing to a live audience. This is a live performance review not a review of their music which is obvioulsy awesome."
620,5,A masterpiece of audio clarity,"The band alone is great, but the audio quality is really something of an achievement. It is a live concert and it sounds like studio quality, definitely a must have for fans and music lovers alike."
621,5,Fantastic DVD!,"The sound of this DVD and the performance are amazing! Fear of a Blank Planet is an album that merits to be performed as a whole musical piece and the performance is unbelieveble. Porcupine Tree are definitely at a peak of their career and I hope that the current peak will last. Way Outta Here, Let's Sleep Together, Anesthetize... All songs on the setlist are actually great. They perform three out of for tracks from the great ""Nil recurring"" as well. A treat for the fans"
622,5,Amazing,Recived the limited edition DVD / BluRay Gray cover edition from PT web site. I am simply amazed by the quality of the video and sound. I have seen PT several times though not on thier most recent tour but this make me feel as if I was there. If you a PT fan this is well worth the investment and if not what a great introduction to PT. I intend to introduce PT through this DVD
623,3,Very nice Group but the quality is poor,"The group is amazing!!For me , this is the New Pink Floyd..The quality of BD is not covered my expectations.The concert took place in a small place -maybe in a club - and the quality of audio and video is not so good.Maybe the lighting of the club is poor."
624,1,"Great band, HORRIBLE video","I don't get it. I love this band and have turned numerous friends on to them. All have been impressed, but their DVDs blow! Almost unwatchable due to there is seldom more than 3 seconds and typically 1 to 1 1/2 seconds of viewing without a camera angle change or change to somewhere else on stage. No continuity whatsoever! Dizzying and not in a good way. I was so excited to watch this. Bought both of the DVDs and watched each to about the 5th song before stopping in complete dissappointment. Watch and judge for yourself, but I became quite sour on these guys due to this, though I love their music and I'm sure this feeling will subside, but the DVDs are in the trash. There is ZERO opportunity to ""get in to the song"" with all of the viewing changes. There are so many awesome live concert videos available from numerous bands, but PT DVDs are NOT them! Sorry PT fans, but you must have received different DVDs than I. But do go and buy ALL of their CDs. Great Band!"
625,3,A bit confusing,"I liked idea of suspense story book set in Caribbean but plot is a bit thin and there are a lot of improbable scenes like selling your own baby, extremely rich and spoiled daughter has dozens of lovers, stretched limos on tiny island...There are more interesting stuff in some history books about real Caribbean islands."
626,1,Awful,"Wow, how bad does it get.It was a chore to read this book. It contains the most unlikely and implausible plot. The characters seemed to be conjured up and very unreal. Not interesting, not funny, not entertaining and it was really hard work to get through it.I droppped my copy in the trash bin when I finished reading it. There is no way I could ever read it again and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.I've never felt this way about any other book. It was awful."
627,4,"Great, but not as good as TGN2","The mix is good, and I liked almost all the tracks, but there was just something misssing in the cd that only TGN2 had. There was more hard trance/goa in TGN2, and TGN3 is more regular trance, which is still really good. My favorite track on this cd is ""Madagascar"" by Art of Trance, it just has an awesome background beat. I'm a stern follower of the TGN series, and I think it's one of the better trance mix series out there. TGN3 is a great cd, and I recommend it to anyone who is a trance lover, or hasn't experienced trance yet. Better yet, get this and TGN2, and you'll really be trancin' it up! =)"
628,4,"Short, insightful and to the point","Before You Think Another Thought is short, insightful and to the point. It is easy to read and the thought process is well developed.There is no question that your circumstances are a direct result of your thought process. While this is a difficult concept for most folks to grasp, it is true and Doyle does a good job of leading the reader to this conclusion.The book is written in simple terms and has a fairly good set of exercises in the appendix.While the concepts are simple, like any process that requires you to change, they are not necessaily easy. In fact the author cautions against trying to make massive changes in your life. Rather giving the sound advice of taking small steps and making one change at a time.These concepts are not new. But they are presented in a fresh and easy to understand manner and can serve as a great way to reinforce what you may have been taught by others.It is certainly worth reading."
629,5,Compact book with Amazing Insights,"Although ""Before you Think Another Thought"" is a relatively small book (less than 125 pages), it's filled with amazing and easy to understand insights about how our underlying beliefs are creating our experiences on a daily basis.The best news is that, although our limiting beliefs have had a great impact on our lives so far, once we identify & explore them, we have the ability to CHOOSE whether or not to keep them as they are, or to change them. If we choose to change them, and replace them with an empowering belief, our lives will begin to change.Mr. Doyle has included many great illustrations & examples to help the reader better grasp the ideas he presents, and has also included an appendix that includes several tools for identifying, exploring and changing our limited underlying beliefs.Overall, I found this to be an interesting, easy to read book with far reaching implications. I would highly recommend it!"
630,2,flawed concept,"Here's my problem: While I do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life, I don't think every single situation in life is one of our own creation. To me, saying that we create everything in our lives through our ""thought vibrations"" is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly. Our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs? Really? So, for example, the Jews killed during the Holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy? Granted, what the author is really talking about is MUCH smaller situations in our everyday lives, ones we can control. But still, this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me. Also, I was looking for more concrete ""how to"" information, which I found a bit lacking in this book. I know the author was going for simplicity, but I found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful."
631,2,Seth,"This book is really a very simplified version of the Seth ideas written down by Jane Roberts in her many books. The Seth books are much more detailed and profound, but for our fast-food society, this book is for those who don't want to take the time to read the real thing."
632,5,A Manual for Life,"Excellent, profound, and illuminating. This book provides an easy-to-grasp explanation of what governs our experiences in life. It also provides a simple method to quickly eliminate and replace our unpleasant experiences with what we really want. More than a book, it is a manual for better living that you will want to refer to on a regular basis."
633,5,The Best Of All Time!,"The A-Team wasn't only the greatest action show of all time, but it also had the best original instrumental music of any television show to ever exist! Every song played in the background of a scene fit that scene perfectly. The action has yet to be equaled (even in today's world of special effects) and the music would make anyone who hears it feel energized to kick some bandit butt!"
634,2,Disappointed...,"For the money ~ I was very disappointed in these earring and I wrote to the seller right a way.I had to go away on a family reunion but I did not even bring them ~ they are not classey looking at all. For Chalcedony I was so sadly let down. Think Twice is my advice! Lynn C. ~ South Jersey, N. J."
635,5,"A ""Must Read"" for Today's Woman!","When it comes to defining a woman's role, PAST TENSE has blown through the glass ceiling! Both the protagonist and antagonist are dynamic and determined. . . equal opponents squaring off in a fast-paced, tension-filled arena. I loved the wonderful mix of humor, tension, passion, and surprises! Can't wait to see what the author writes next!"
636,4,I'm the author,"I am the author of this book. It is no longer being printed. I gave it only four stars because its 2009 successor is deserving of five stars.Go to the following Amazon.com page to see West Side Publishing's ""Armchair Reader: The Last Survivors of Historical Events, Movies, Disasters, and More""Armchair Reader: The Last Survivors of Historical Events, Movies, Disasters, and MoreRobert Ernest Hubbard"
637,2,"Good Computer Screen Quality, But....","I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera.The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft."
638,2,Believe the negative reviews,"As a realtor, I was very excited about this camera for wide angle interior shots at a low price in a very compact package. Unfortunately, the picture quality is very dissapointing. The images are barely adequate for web posting and brochure printing. Pictures are very soft and seem out of focus. I'll keep using it until I can find a better alternative without dropping over a grand on a digital SLR with a wide angle lense. If anyone know of a better quality, compact wide angle - please let me know!"
639,4,kodak camera,"The picture quality is good, but when you take the flash off you have to hold still to take a picture or it will blur. If you have the flash on and you are moving or are in a car taking a picture it will not blur.Overall i really like this camera and the wide viewing screen is awesome"
640,3,"Some good, some bad","This camera has a lot of really nice features, especially the panoramic ""stitching."" I wish they had paid more attention to picture quality in low light. I cannot find settings that don't make some photos look dark and speckled."
641,2,Love the camera but buyers BEWARE!!!,"I love everything about this camera BUT....The display is very touchy. I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. My display shattered. Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!"
642,2,Not Happy With This Camera,"I have many digital cameras, thought I would try the V705.The anti blur technology does not work very good, if at all.Doesnt support high speed SD cards.Uses Hi Compression, no way to change it = low quality Pictures.Quick Time Video is not a good mode, I would like AVISCN Custom mode is a joke.I talked to Kodak about these things and they are sorry.I will stick with a Winner, hp R817."
643,4,"Capture the Room, Capture the View, Capture the Mood","This camera was purchased primarily for real estate use. Wide angle photos that capture the whole room, floor and ceiling even. I just too prom photos of my kids at the Hyatt Coconut Point in Bonita Springs, Florida. They've been asked by their friends if we hired a professional photographer. I'm pleased with the equipment and it is very easy to use - without even reading the manual :)"
644,3,the cover is different,I received the book pretty late. i ordered two other books with this one and those two books arrived one week before this one. and when i opened the package i could see that the cover is different from what the seller show on the website. the cover is brown and looks really old.
645,4,"Interesting, But Not Exactly for the People-Magazine-Type Reader","Mr. Erikson wrote a thought-provoking book, but it is certainly a product of his times. Such notions as homosexuality being deviant (his word, not mine) behavior and was more of a symptom of a psychologically damaged individual has not held up to present scientific evidence. Overall, the book is a fascinating dissection of childhood development and how it possibly manifests itself in adulthood. But reading this material wasn't exactly a cake walk. I doubt many casual readers could wade through Mr. Erikson's book without developing MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over) Syndrome. For what it's worth, I enjoyed most of it."
646,5,Basic tool of an educated person - must have,"A profound, orginal work that changes the entire worldview and saves the lives of many young adults by giving them insight into who they are and how they got that way."
647,4,very handy,"Childhood and Society guides its readers far deep into children's mind and its pychological intricacies. Using study of cases carefully chosen and great psychoanalytical knowlege, Erikson, with his long experience, enlight us, making easy to undertand some of the most complicated concepts in Freud's theory.It's sure a worth reading work."
648,3,Movie: Great. Sound: Bad.,"As every horror-movie fan knows, this film couldn't be better. Especially note-worthy on DVD is the scene where Mia Farrow gets pregnant. I had only seen this film on TV, and it was completely edited out. The scene is very creepy, and the devil actually makes an appearance. My only criticism with the DVD is the sound. It is Dolby Digital MONO. Not very exciting. We should be able to expect more by now from all DVD manufacturers. Please don't push DVD titles onto the market until they are truly DVD-worthy, technically."
649,4,excellent!,"not a huge fan of Mia Farrow but she was EXCELLENT in this! this film centers around her and her husband who live in an old apartment building in NYC and theyre trying to have a baby. They have a few problems with a nosy old couple who turn out to be witches after their baby, and it turns out the husband was in it all along. no one believes her when she suspects these people, so they are all against her. i dont want to tell you the end, that would spoil it, LOL i know its fiction but the only thing i have a problem with the film is the fact that witches are always being portrayed as evil, and they are not...i guess alot of films would not have been made if they didnt believe that."
650,2,Did I see the wrong movie?,"Okay, some of the reviews said that this was better than the Exorcist (if that was humanly possible), and it wasn't. After seeing the Exorcist, no other scary movie compares. This had an easy plot to follow, lots of chanting, and a bunch of crazy witches saying Hail Satan! The scariest part of this movie is the FBI warning at the beggining. I gave it two stars for the opening song, but other than that skip it. Almost as stupid as The Other. Not The Others, The Other. The Exorcist is way better, and I'm not a die hard Exorcist fan, The Exorcist is simply the Scariest movie ever, because demonic possesion is very real. I was ""privleged"" to witness one, and I still have nightmares to this day. This is another dumb anti-christ movie. The only good one was The Omen. Skip this and rent The Exorcist or The Omen."
651,3,It's not scary !!!!! probably was scary in the 60s,"This movie is not scary, not suspenseful, not frightening nada. It's however interesting piece of history. I enjoyed the acting because i never really watched a movie from the 60's before. The old nosy lady was interesting and she added a bit of humor to the film. It probably was a classic in it's day but in 2009 no. It's 2 hours long too."
652,4,A Classic Tale Of Naivety,"100 years from now, actress Mia Farrow will be remembered in her role in this classic ""horror"" movie, much more than her current role as an activist with the United Nations (UN). This aged ""horror"" movie may be a drag, but shows the supreme acting finesse of Mia Farrow. She plays a naive woman whose husband got too friendly with their Satanist neighbours. She ends up being used, conned and abused. It teaches you not to be too trusting with people with strange practices and behaviours.If you're looking for scary scenes based on 21st century digital standards, there are none. But, back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this movie was still talked about, at least till ""The Exorcist"" came around and trumped all horror cards as the best remembered classic horror movie of all time.Recommended viewing:The Exorcist: Director's Cut (Extended Edition)The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)"
653,3,Rosemarys baby,it was okay... i think they should make a movie about the second book... or remake the first one and include the other book...
654,5,Classic horror,"This is one of my absolute favorite horror movies of all time...no gore, no heavy, cheesy special effects, just plot and suspense-building to the end."
655,2,Boring and stupid!,"Oh my god! This movie was so pathetic. I rented it hoping it would be good like I had heard. But no! What I saw was the most stupid and boring movie! The acting was good and so was the story, but the movie sucked, STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!"
656,3,Eh,"I don't see what all the fuss is about. It was an interesting concept for a story, but the woman is so stupid that by the end its hard to really care about her. Its one thing to risk yourself naively but when you don't follow your instincts with your child its inexcusable. And the end was just silly."
657,5,"Not the best horror movie, the best movie.","Seen it 40 times. This movie is perfect. It is astonishing that it was made so long ago.The entire movie is a buildup to the final sequence where she accepts the child. Though shocking, we realize it's not the least bit of a surprise - given her devotion to what she carried for so many months.Best line: ""He has his father's eyes"""
658,3,"Not a horror film as such, but entertaining","If you have never seen Rosemary's Baby, see if for the fine film-making that it is. Remember that it was made in 1968 so it would have been quite scary for audiences then. Noted on the back as ""probably the best horror film ever made"", my response to that would be ""probably not"".What I did like about Rosemary's Baby were the excellent performances by all actors, including Mia Farrow as Rosemary, and Ruth Gordon as the nosey neighbour. Rosemary is convinced that those around her plan to cause her unborn baby harm. A film that deserves to be seen at least once, particularly as it is a Roman Polanski film.DVD SUMMARY: Considering the film was made in 1968, the special features are quite impressive. An interview with Robert Evans and Roman Polanski starts it off, then a featurette which contains some excellent behind the scenes footage! This featurette was made at the time of production so is a bit grainy, but nevertheless pure gold."
659,3,This isn't a horror movie,"It's more like a thriller. When i read the reviews for this movie i thought i was gonna have the [pooh] scared out of me, but i was mislead. In no way, shape or form is this movie scary. I gave it three stars because it is a good story. It takes 2 hours for this movie to take off, and when it finally does, it's the end of the movie. It's pretty weird too. This film does have some great actors in it, who all do a fantastic job. If your looking for a real scary film, look elsewhere, but for a great story and some thrills here and there, than this is what your looking for."
660,2,Boring,"I thought it was idiotic & at times downright silly. At the end I felt like laughing. If I had been a kid watching this I guess I might have felt the ""horror"" others talk about but as an adult it was nothing more than nonsensical tripe."
661,4,Expectant Mothers Beware!,"The film adaptation is quite good but not as good as the original novel. Polanski is in his usual spooky form with his direction and Ruth Gordon shines in her role. And what can be said about Mia Farrow that hasn't already been said. Mia Farrow, narrow as an arrow! Flat as a pancake is a bit better: both herself and her performance. The film holds up well over the years. Too bad Mia didn't. But there wasn't much to hold up, even back then. Amazon has a really good price on this one."
662,3,Not bad,"Some years ago husband, mother, and I went to Walmart looking for a scary movie. Mom told us that ROsemary's Baby is a good scary movie. So we bought it. We didn't like it. We thought it was boring. Well years later I just finish watching it and I thought it was a pretty good movie. I guess before we expected so much more from a scare movie. But for this being an old movie it wasn't bad."
663,4,This movie ROCKS!,"Young couple becomes pregnant with the child of the devil and the mother's friends and neighbors try to cover it up. While some might say this is boring, it's really interesting and spellbinding. Gotta love that ending. Popcorn, Pepsi and Pizza."
664,5,Classic,"One of my favorite horror films, this one had my skin crawling. Beautifully real and subtly terrifying. Watch it and love it."
665,5,Rosemary's Baby,"A subtly demonic tale that builds to a shocking climax. Mia Farrow embodies vulnerability as Rosemary, and John Cassavetes is interesting to watch in a rare mainstream role as her soothing husband. Look for a young Charles Grodin playing a doctor in a pivotal scene."
666,1,What a disappointment,"From reviews I had thought RB would be a genuine thriller.The only thing I found thrilling was the realization after anhour or so that the film would soon be over. Can't understand why anyone would make the effort to mentally get into this film.I found it corny and I'm certainly glad I didn't pay for the DVDthat I watched. Everything about this film was heavy - heavy acting, heavy scripting. Heavy,heavy, heavy."
667,1,am I dreaming?,"Some years ago i saw ""Rosemary's Baby"", and I am positive that at the end of the film Rosemary looks into the cradle and sees her baby. The baby has claws for hands and yellow eyes. In the version I just saw, however, there is no view of the baby. Was I dreaming?"
668,5,Brilliant.,"Certainly on my ten-best list, ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the most frightening films ever made. The genius of the film is that it juxtaposes the mundane with the most beastly and achieves it with little graphic violence. The carnage occurs mostly off-screen and we see the crowd in the street or hear the terrible news over the phone just as we would in real-life.Polanski plays (or preys) masterfully on natural human paranoia and allows the viewer's imagination to construct the most heinous outcome. Mia Farrow is the innocent who is led by her ""loving"" husband, respected doctor and eccentric neighbors into a woman's worst nightmare."
669,4,A Chilling and powerful horror movie,"Roman Polanski does a great job at directing this superb horror movie based on the novel by Ira Levin. Set in the eerie Dakota building in NYC, this witty film is ranked as one of the best classic modern day thrillers. Mia Farrow's performance is good. And Ruth Gordon's is a gem."
670,5,Terrified in Connecticut,Rosemary's baby is a horror classic that should not be missed. Mia Farrow and the rest of the cast is outstanding in this tale of broken trust and Santanic eroticism.This film will be loved by anyone who isn't pregnant.
671,5,A Face Only A Mother Could Love !!,"Yes, Devil Conspiracy at it's finest..this is a true 1960ish classic and another epic from Roman Polanski.How the lifestyle of Doris Day becomes satanic..This Devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid 1960's coming as it did with the saga of Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and Polanski somehow tied into all of this.Nonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness, Lucifer, evil with the premise of the birth of the antichrist.Rosemary herself (a witch not by choice), battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win.... This movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of Rosemary.A truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil, passion and reason, a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future stars.The extras are good."
672,1,Yawn.,"The TV Guide called it probably the best horror movie ever made. This was supposed to be a classic? I guess it was a classic con-job. Mia's character, or was it just Mia, was so unbelievable. The whole tale seems so, simplistic? Oh let's not go over for dinner, oh we will, oh it is so ironic Guy's suddenly taken a liking to his neighbors. The 'suggestions' and red-herrings didn't help much in alleviating the pain of a sad non-ending. I would recommend this to film buffs only. For me, at the end of two and a half hours, it felt like nothing much had happened."
673,1,I dont get it?,"I am a very big fan of horror movies, I have been snice I was around 5 or so. This was on sometime during Hallooween on AMC, and it was always one of the ""100 Most Horror Movies"" on Bravo. When I watched it before that show was on I saw a few parts and though to myself when does the good part come?..But I ended up about to fall asleep so I taped it, but not every part came on, then I watched it again and though to myself this is not even scary what makes it so scary?...The movies mostly about a young women and her husband who want a kid, then when she gets it(supposly she's rapped by the devil), and her kids the devil living inside her, but nothing really scary happened I was pretty dispointed."
674,1,A waste of a good plot,"I thought that this movie was going to be scary, and terrifying. In the end, it was stupid and meaningless. The plot was good, but it was played out all wrong. It was a waste of a good 2 and a half hours and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
675,2,Not a Masterpiece.,"First off it was made by a Perv, Second it is creepy with everybody in on it type of thing, and it's representative of the era and Hollywood's Obsession with The Bizarre and Plain dumb. Masterpiece? NO."
676,2,Disappointing - not good for a 2 year old,"This was very disappointing, we bought the Bob the Builder version for our 2 year old, and he had the same problems as the previous reviewer with stickers ripping. The reusability factor was also not there, after a 2 year old pulling them off and trying to reapply them just the first time, they were curling up at all the edges and not staying sticky. The other problem with this book is that the pages are non-contiguous posters, which means for him to use them as whole pictures, without pulling out 3 staples and then losing posters and stickers. All in all, I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a very poor book for little kiddos."
677,5,A big hit!,"My 23-month-old LOVES this sticker book. He has been using it almost every day for a month, and he still loves it. I sit with him while he plays with it to help him bring the edges of the stickers up from the pages. The stickers are losing their stickiness now, but it was a good deal for a month of play!"
678,5,Centre Stage-Michael Ball,"Hit after Hit. A must for all Michael Ball fans. Each new album outdoes his last, yet each are great. The selection of songs is outstanding and each features the true prue voice of Michael in all ranges. Michael again proves he could star in any musical of his choice. His choice of ""Immortality"" and ""Can You Feel the Love"" will totally capitivate you!"
679,5,Fantastic!,"After listening to Michael Ball on the Complete Symphonic Recording of Les Miserables and seeing him again on the Miz DVD, I must say I was very impressed by this CD. He has a very sultry voice that is one that both soothes and gets the blood pumping. I love ""Boy From Nowhere"", ""Winner Takes It All"" and of course the two Phantom of the Opera selections. His vocals are really something else and for a starter Michael Ball CD, this would be the one to buy."
680,5,Fantastic album!,"I very highly recommend this album. It's one of Michael Ball's best. He has such a beautiful voice. His rendition of ""Not While I'm Around,"" is so beautiful. All the other songs he sings are great as well. He also does some songs from, ""Phantom,"". If you listen to it I believe most people would love it and enjoy his voice."
681,5,Centre Stage,"THIS IS MICHAEL BALL'S BEST WORK,YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM ALL OVER AGAIN.THIS CD TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.THE SONG'S A BOY FROM NO WHERE AND THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL ARE MY ALL TIME FAVORITE'S.I HAVE EVERY CD HE HAS MADE,HE GETS 100 STARS FOR THIS ONE."
682,2,Not another over the top CD,"I am really bothered by the way Michael Ball delivered the songs in this CD. He is so over-acting, no subtlety whatsover. It sounded amateurish and over-done. I hope he learns how to town down in the future. His take on ""The Winner Takes it All"" is so softy in approach. Please, no more over the top performace. Only Barbra Streisand can pull that one!!!!"
683,1,Not Again!,"I keep hoping that Ball will release an album that isn't as overproduced as his vibrato but I have yet to hear it. How can an album this uncreative seem so pretentious? I wish Ball would follow in the footsteps of Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone and others who have toned down their vocals and orchesrations and give us a more intimate and diverse look at what he can do. Please save the theatrics for the Original Cast Albums!Just my opinion.JMF"
684,4,"""Michael's style & charm come shining through""","Look out folks, when Ball is on...he's untouchable. One of those rare artists who gives it all he's got, and then some. Michaelstarted his career in Musical Theatre, his love of performing is completely honest...and it shows.Choosing stand outs, much less highlights is tough, but here goes ~ ""SEASON'S OF LOVE""...""THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL""...""CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT""...""LIFT THE WINGS"", the lyrics give Michael the power that creeps deep within your reasoning for ""pure enjoyment""...Ball shows his versatility with light tones and tender feelings that make each song his own, gotta love it.Following this entertainer is exciting, just the way he handles himself is magic...his performance is top notch...not many singers today can belt out a tune and keep you spellbound...thank you Hip-O, for giving us a front row seat and CENTRE STAGE!Total Time: 38:18 on 14 Tracks ~ Universal/Hip-O Records 016071 ~ (2002)"
685,3,Bosch coffeemaker,The product was sent very quickly and the coffeemaker makes excellent coffee. I was surprised that there was no warranty available. Upon reaching the distributor I was told my sales slip would act as a warranty. Rather than returning the coffeemaker to the distributor I decided to keep it and hope nothing goes wrong with it.
686,5,comprehensive contemporary documentary of China,"Granted, I have not spent a great deal of time learning about China, nor have I ever BEEN to China. But I was very impressed with all of the aspects of China covered in this documentary. The film packs a lot of information into this little package! Contemporary China may both match your expectations and blow them out of the water. If you want to be entertained and informed about a diverse world quite different from the US, I recommend this film!"
687,5,Italy revealed,Very well done video with different indendant living scenarios by native Italians which makes it even more personal and interesting !Narration by ISABELLA ROSELLINI IS WELL DONE WITH AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FLAVOR.................BEING ITALIAN THIS IS WELL APPRECIATED.
688,4,Unbelieveable video and interesting stories,"Unlike most of the reviews here, I was able to play this HD DVD without any problems. I use my Xbox 360 to play HD DVDs, which is able to automatically get any updates that are needed.Anyway, the movie follows the stories of multiple Italian people, all of different ages and background, as they embark on different milestones in their lives. The video is full of beautiful shots with great hi-def detail. The narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak English.I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Italy. My wife and I went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited."
689,1,Poor Job,I got all four Discovery HD DVD's. Brazil and China work fine on my ToshibaA-2. Italy and Australia do not. I returned them to Amazon and the replacements did not work either. Then I started reading and found many otherpeople with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with thesetwo disc's. These two will go back tomorrow. It's a shame Discovery did sucha poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering howfew different models of HD DVD Players there are out on the market.
690,1,Wish I had read the reviews ...,"These videos are fantastic from a documentary perspective, but someone on the manufacturing crew screwed up the Italy & Austrailia disks. DO NOT BUY until the problem is fixed ... you'll just have to send them back."
691,1,Don't waste your time,I purchased this DVD with much enthusiasm only to find that it dose not play on my combo bluray/HD player.I send it back for replacement and it still would not play and had to finally return it all together.It seem from reading other reviews this is typical of this title (or series). Don't waste your time buying this DVD.
692,2,Disappointed,"I only wish that more time was devoted to the natural beauty of Italy and its cities,towns and natural coutryside, particulary in the north, as opposed to horse racing, auto racing etc."
693,2,Discovery Atlas:Italy Revealed,"When I selected the DVD Discovery Atlas: Italy Revealed, I anticipated a visual tour of Italy's major cities. Instead, it is the story of a goup of people challenged to achieve personal goals. The DVD focuses on the personal struggles and objectives, which frankly I am not interested! The cinematography is beautiful, and Isabella Rossellini's voice is charming, soothing, and will put you to sleep."
694,1,Discovery Atlas: Italy Revealed [HD DVD],I received this HD DVD twice. Both were defective as neither would even boot.
695,2,Hardware Issue,"After a tremendous amount of research, I was able to get to the bottom of the issue w/the HD version of Atlas/Aust. Revealed. I have confirmed that a firmware update is available from Toshiba players that will resolve the playback issues. A Microsoft update is currently not available but will be soon."
696,1,BE WARNED: DOES NOT WORK,Do not order this DVD. It does not work. The HD player will tell you that it cannot load it (error message) after 10 minutes of trying. Looks like everyone else has had this problem as well. I called Amazon for a refund and recommended that they pull this item. It DOES NOT PLAY.
697,3,Good functionality - big and bulky are downfalls,"I use the Microtek ScanMaker 4 in a professional setting as a web designer. The photos scan fairly fast so I have few complaints there. It has an optional tray that can be switched out for different mediums whether slideshow film, negatives, etc. Then, the flatbed on top is legal size, which is standard. I have mine plugged via scsi card and get decent speed.My primary complaint of this scanner is primarily the size. It takes up a large portion of my work desk and its heavy in terms of scanners of similar quality. It stands about 6"" high, about 13"" wide and 21"" deep (approximations).If you can get past the size of the machine, it's not bad. This model is no longer in production so you'll likely get it used. It's a decent little machine but I reckon it is becoming obsolete now."
698,1,Didn't Like It,"Jesse Stuart is a school teacher from Kentucky and should have stayed that way. This book seemed like an attempt to get attention in 1949 for his teaching skills. He my have been a good teacher but he wasn't a good writer.The Thread That Runs So True never caught my attention. The book was dull and boring. The book wasn't worth my $14.00. Jesse Stuart gets too much in detail with his story. A lot of the time he is talking about his money troubles and give us acual estimates. The Chicago Sun my have said ""stuart's joy for living illuminates every page."" but I never saw that illumination. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
699,1,Lower Than Low,"After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs. The only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the ""man"" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read."
700,2,A Boastful Thread That Runs So True,"I just finished reading this book. I too, am a teacher with many years of experience. I felt that Jesse Stuart spent the majority of his words glorifying his macho self image. Maybe, in his day, this was acceptable behavior for school personnel...thank goodness we have evolved to a more tolerant, loving, and understanding mode of operating our schools."
701,4,An Inspirational Story,"The thread That Runs So True autobiographical story is a personal writing about his teaching career. He narrates a several experiences regarding his teaching and how he had to face difficult situation to remain teaching at school with success. However, he persevered and got success with his students. His students demonstrated interest and enjoyed learning as a consequence of his method of teaching with new ideas, trying to get interest and attention from his students. I enjoyed the way he narrates his experiences with tender feelings towards his students and courage to confront different situations as a teacher in the mountain region of Kentucky. I believe The Thread that Runs so True is a great example to follow for teachers and works as an inspiration for them in order to obtain the same results as Jesse Stuart"
702,4,A true classic,I first read Jesse Stuart 30 years ago in high school. I remember giving an oral book report to my English teacher and expressing surprise that rural Kentucky teachers continued to teach even when they were not receiving their pay. I remember my teacher telling me-- in all sincerity-- that she would do the same thing. Wow. I never looked at teaching the same way again!The only reason I give this book 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish Stuart had delved more deeply into the characters in the beginning of the book. There was certainly enough material there for an entire book by itself-- then Stuart could have used his years as a high school principal for a second book.
703,5,Could have used this a lot earlier in life,Reading this book-I couldn't help but feel that I've wasted so muchof my life being unhappy by choice. I'll even venture to say thatthe option method could change the world as we know it if more peopleknew about it and practiced it.A book I'll continue to revisit throughout my life.
704,2,I don't like it at all.,"I don't like it, feels like paper. i buoght this item because it of the price it was on.Ima throw them in a couple of month. Make my money worth."
705,4,good product,the sizing was accurate. they are a good product and true to the description given. i would buy them again.
706,3,incorrect sizing on website,"My husband bought these; luckily they are darker than in the photo. The BIG problem is that the ""merchant's sizing chart"" that Amazon includes as a link for this item is incorrect. Amazon lists the waist size for a Medium as being 32-34"", when the sizing for Hanes makes a Medium a 34-36"", so these boxers are too large for him. We'll be asking to have the shipping charge refunded, and order the smaller size."
707,1,boxers,"No I won't purchase Hanes Boxers again. I don't like the seams in them, and they ended up as clean up rags in the garage."
708,2,Generic,I wanted something a little more specific to the African American child in terms of race and self esteem considering the prejudice that my child will have to come to terms with.This book only offered one chapter on that and not a very insightful one.
709,5,One of the Best Films of the 80's,"As Judith, Maggie Smith turns in the performance of a lifetime and oneof the best and most complete portrayals by any actor on film. This isan astonishing film, full of bleak Irish heartbreak, yet with thepromise of hope.Smith is a no less than a revelation in the title role and one cannothelp but route for this desperate character even when all lookshopeless. The screenplay had been fought over for years by actresses ofevery stripe, with, for a while, Jane Fonda, leading the pack ofactresses trying to get Judith onto the screen. It's a good thingMaggie Smith won out.The ensemble cast of actors led by Bob Hoskins is fully up to Smith'sstandard and the emotional wallops this movie packs are big onesindeed.George Delarue's score is simply perfect underlying with the exactweight and gravity - and sweetness - of every situation.When is this thing coming out on DVD? It's simply ridiculous it hasn'tyet appeared.Highest recommendation."
710,4,"Take a Chance, You Won't Be Disappointed!","Chance for the Future simply moves. It has action, adventure, elements of surprise, some comedy, and is a good read. I'm an avid science fiction reader and this book held my attention. I think that even those who would never pick up a sci-fi novel (including my wife and daughter) would enjoy this book because the lead character is a strong female. For his first novel, Carhart has done a good job. Take a Chance with Chance for The Future."
711,4,Cool bike,The only thing i have to say is that the assembly was not as easy as i thought and at the end i had to bring it to a bike shop to get the final touches. but as soon as it was assembeled i had a lot of fun with it. It is a cool to bike around with.
712,5,A great bike for the price I paid...,"I bought two of these bikes, before Christmas and when they were selling for one-fifty, which was an awesome price for an awesome bike. The bikes were relatively easy to put together - you have to install the handle-bars, seat post and seat, from wheel and the front disk brake (the only really tricky part), and it took me about an hour. Everything else is pre-assembled, and that is done very well too.The quality of the bike is just great - everything feels really solid and well-built. My only complaint is that for an all-aluminum frame they are surprisingly heavy, so even with the 21 speeds this is not a good bike for anyone living in a particularly hilly area.But even at two-fifty, these bikes are half the price of comparable comfort bikes at your local bike shop, and you can't even find comfort bikes with disk brakes from what I can see, so that makes the deal for me."
713,4,Good Simple Bike,"This bike was fairly easy to assemple ... Though I must mention that I did not get assembly instructions as others have noted as well. I did find it rater easy to assemble once thinking about it though .. I spent probably about 45 min in all, and other 20Min tuning the disk brakes and height adjustments.My GF says it is a great ride, really smooth, and brakes work great ... comfortable seat. Worth the sale price I got it at .. not worth full price ;-)"
714,2,"Nice bike, but no pedals or instructions","I know the bike is great, and everybody that reviewed it agrees with that. However, either Cadillac or Amazon are making a good product be more a hassle than a pleasure. Not only did I not get instructions (which others have remarked on), but no pedals!!! After reading all reviews, there is one other person complaining it did not have a kick stand. Mine does, but now, up to fighting for those pedals. Overall, knowing about these problems, better go with another one. I don't know if I want to go through the hassle of returning it, but maybe I will just in hopes they will do something about the poor packaging quality. There is a Columbia comfort bike that was my alternate choice."
715,4,Nice Bike,"Free shipping arrived in 5 days as advertised. Shipping box was torn up with a minor blemish on the paint. Assembly took 45 minutes, there were no instructions. I had to reinstall the front forks (remember, front and rear disk brakes are on the same side) got em backwards the first time. Both derailers needed adjusting to shift correctly and quietly. Welds are a bit rough but the bike is a good deal and the quality is good. I might buy another for myself."
716,5,Shredded packaging,"The bike was every thing advertised and more. It was delivered promptly, but the box was in shreds thank goodness by some miracle everything stayed inside and assembly was a snap."
717,1,Major Skip Problem,"While the memorex CD player did impress me with it's ability to read through scratches in the CD, it had absolutely no anti-skip protection. Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute. I would definitly recommend spending another $10 or $15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection!"
718,2,Not good---at all!,"I bought this figuring I got a good deal on a CD player, turns out I just wasted my money. The headphones were horrible, they had a lot of static. And the player itself, well it had to be on a completely flat surface. In a car is not a good place to listen to it. It skips often, and it broke only after a month of purchase."
719,1,good for the money,"I, too, purchased this CD player for my 8 year old daughter. I am really impressed with the sound quality for the price. If you plan to leave this player stationary (on a desk, etc.), I think you will be more then pleased. Also, it's an excellent gift for a young child, who doesn't need a top-of-the-line player. The price is VERY reasonable, and the unit is straightforward and easy to use."
720,1,This Products Breaks ten days after 90 day Warranty,"I bought this product in April. Worked until July. Without reason, display will not respond. I called the manufacture and they said they will not fix after 90 days. Shouldn't a brand new cd player work for atleast a year before something internal breaks. I guess Memorex doesn't think so. For $[money] they said they would look at it. I told them I don't think it's a good idea to send good money after bad. I'll buy a different brand name instead."
721,1,Incredible (How could anything be this bad),"I had this piece of junk for 3 months. When I put in a CD, static was audible in the background. At first, I thought it was the CD. Then I put it in my Aiwa stereo system and the sound was flawless. The radio reception was even worse. You have to turn the thing around in circles to hear anything but static. This so-called machine may be cheap, but I wouldn't want it if it was free!"
722,3,"Good for the value, but has all the flaws of this value, too","This player plays well, if you OK with the fact that it does not have the stabilizer (so, whenever there is a slightest movement, the play is interrupted). Also, it did not come with batteries (which, I personally hate), and the carrying case included as a bonus is kinda funny looking and impractical. But the LCD, phones, and all the buttons work well."
723,2,low volume,"While I expected the CD to occasionally skip, I was disappointed in how low the volume was.I had a Sony Discman and the volume was low on that, but with this player it's ridiculous."
724,1,This is definitely a low quality product,"If you want a cd player better spend a few extra bucks on a major namebrand product. I received this cd player yesterday and I'm returning it today. How bad could it be? Man, this is really a cheap and inferior product. The cd would skip frequently the track it was playing; there is a lot of static in the sound;it has low volume; and it has the cheapest construction in the world. You gotta be extremely careful when inserting a cd. The arm where the cd holder sits (i believe the lens runs along this part) will considerably move downwards to the slightest force. I agree with Bruce from NY. I don't want this cd player even for free. After returning this product I purchased a Sony cd player. Sure it was more expensive, but is working fine. Believe me, you'll regret purchasing this Memorex MD3020 cd player."
725,4,Great Player!,"This player is a great one! But this player would not be good for jogging,because it skips a little when you jog."
726,1,Not worth your money,"These DVD's are not worth your money! Picture and sound qualities are very bad, it looks like the DVD itself were re-recorded from a VHS, you can hardly understand anything the lady is saying because very poor sound and the items on the pattern envelopes are blurry you can't understand anything. Waist of your money!"
727,3,Good supplement to Melville's Moby Dick,"I enjoyed reading THE HEART OF THE SEA as a supplement to other great novels based on fictional and non fictional sea disasters, such as MOBY DICK. THE HEART OF THE SEA is a good historical documentation of life of the whaler, and the hazards of the sea. I did not find the author's writing style to be particularly inspirational, rather it was flat with descriptions that did not evoke true passion for the individuals that endured such tragic circumstance. I am going to read ISAAC'S STORM next, as it was mentioned in an earlier review on this site."
728,4,Powerful story!,"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It's the true story of the 19th century whaleship that was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale, and the 93-day ordeal of the crew fighting to survive (most didn't) in the three small whaleboats. (And of course, the book ""Moby-Dick"" was in part based on this event.)I thought the author did a fantastic job of telling the story, and while doing so injected bits of relevant history and science that helps the reader better understand the story and its context. It got me interested in doing additional reading on the whaling industry. (And who knows. . . maybe I'll be able to visit Nantucket someday!)"
729,5,Captivating!,"One of the best books I've read in a very long time. The author Nathaniel Philbrick does an absolutely superb job narrating the tragic tale of the whaleship Essex; not only does he give you an up close view of the ordeal the stranded sailors went through but he also gives a detailed (and interesting) look into the whaling business as well as life on the island of Nantucket in the late 1800s. From beginning to end I was caught up in the story, it would be a true shame if ""In the Heart of the Sea"" doesn't become a classic and the story of the Essex's crew becomes lost once more in the mists of time."
730,5,Cant believe no one has bought the screen rights to this yet.,"Excellent read and excellent story.if done right this would be an awesome film.Getting the period right, the ship of the early 1800s, the whale attach and the story of survival -shown realistically and not exploitvily or gratuitious, the whale attack.this is a story begging to be told on the big screen. It would also make more people aware of this story that is, when first told of it, very hard to believe."
731,5,In the Heart of the Sea,"I actually haven't had a chance to read it yet but I will say that anything by Nathaniel Philbrick has to be very good. More to the point, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" did not win the National Book Award for nothing!"
732,5,A quick & entertaining read,"I'm not a fisherman or do I have much interest in boats, the ocean, etc. My brother-in-law recommended this book and I cannot use enough superlatives to describe what an enjoyable book this is. The historical details are intriguing and the story of the ill-fated whaling voyage is truly riveting. Even though you know how it ends, the story is so engrossing that I read this in a matter of days. Bring it to the beach, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
733,5,A RIP-ROARING ADVENTURE!,"I am only about 2/3 through this book, but just have to say it is the most rip-roaring adventure book I have ever read! It is full of information about the early 1800s, the whaling industry, the sea, and about whales that I have never known. It is all fascinating! Although I am a girl (ahem!), I am loving every word of this book, as I also loved THE ENDURANCE and INTO THIN AIR and A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY recently, not to mention TARZAN, FRANKENSTEIN, etc. from years back. This book is highly recommended whether you fancy yourself an adventurer (armchair adventurers okay) or not."
734,3,I enjoyed this book...,I enjoyed this book. I am currently deployed oversees and this book got to me in speed time! I have recently visited Nantucket(where this novel is based) is it was really neat to read a book about some of the history of it!
735,4,hmmm... kinda nice book to read...,"first of all, despite all the nice explanation of Essex, it's doubtful that this book won the national book award. i think there are bunch of books out there which wait for winning the award, and certainly have better stuffs. but i can't criticize this book. (i'm not a book-review-person or what..) anyway... this book was just a regular book to me."
736,3,Not to say this book wasn't interesting...,"This book is no doubt an incredibly well researched account of the story behind the Essex. However, it was very dry and I couldn't connect with the people aboard the ship! This made it very hard for me to have any emotions at all while I was reading, and therefore made this book less enjoyable for me! I would only recommend this book to you if you are interested in the story behind the Essex (which, as I said, is very well researched and detailed!) and not in the emotions!"
737,3,"Great survival story, but many stories like it.","This is a gripping, chilling, interesting, true story of the sinking of the Essex whaleship. I think you can spot some thematic material and symbols waiting to be created from this story in a work of fiction. Herman Meliville did and Philbrick's book makes a good pre-reading to ""Moby Dick"".The beginning and the ending I found to be boring and dry. Those sections contain more of the historical backround and afterword.It is a great story of survival and endurance- testing the limits of the human body and psyche. If you liked this book, I recommend the book ""Hatchet"" which is also a survival story, altough a fictional one. In the Heart of the Sea is much like the sea survival stories of ""Jaws"" and the ""Perfect Storm"" so I don't think there is anything special about this book."
738,3,"slow shipping, book in decent shape","The title of my review says it all. I've ordered a lot of books from Amazon sellers, so I know how long it takes for a book to arrive. The book was in good enough shape, but it took weeks - weeks - to arrive."
739,5,And we complain about being thirsty...,"This book is a wonderfully written true tale of the disaster of the whaleship Essex. This crew of Nantucketers and off-islanders endured the most horrible adventure at sea. An enourmous Sperm Whale rams the boat and sends these men into a 90-day whirlwind of starvation, dehydration, delusion, despair, insanity, death, and eventual recovery. The way Nathaniel Philbrick depicts every aspect of their hellish journey puts you at the helm. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know what REALLY happened to the crew of the whaleship Essex back in the early 19th century, and how Melville was inspired to write his famous novel ""Moby Dick""."
740,3,Heart of the Sea,"The heart of the sea is a griping and page turning book. There are tons of stories about ships lost at sea. This is the first book that I have read that went in to so much detail of what happened. In the begin is not as good the history of Nantucket is not something I wanted to read. But I do have to admit that the way Nathaniel philbrick described the little close nit town was very descriptive. He made it seem like you were looking a photo of it. The book did give me some incite into how it was back then. How life was on the ship not seeing your family for years. After you get through the first couple of chapters the book starts to pick up. It is like you are reliving the whole experience of the sinking of the Essex. I would not recommend this book for animal lovers, being one my self reading what they do to the whales and other animals just to survive made me sick. But over all it is a fairly good story."
741,3,"OK, not great","This is not a bad book, but it is weighed down a bit by the numerous facts. It is good to know that it was researched entensively before being written, but a little too much left in the book. I would have prefered that this was a fast paced exciting read, like The Perfect Storm, but it isn't. If you are interested in the Whaling business and related subjects, you may enjoy it."
742,2,Great book but Kindle price is insane,"An excellent book that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bought the paperback for less than $3, yet Amazon & the greedy publisher think I'd be dumb enough to pay $13 for the Kindle ebook??? Was thinking about buying a Kindle. After looking at the Kindle prices of most books still covered by copyright, though, I definitely will not. I can buy the REAL book for about the same price brand-new in most cases, and substantially cheaper if I buy a used copy. Besides a truly backward price, with a Kindle version I'd also lose the ability to do any of the following: lend out my books anytime I want to anybody I choose, donate them to libraries or secondhand stores, or trade them in for credit towards other books at a used bookstore. Net result: current ebooks = epic FAIL on value."
743,1,Go to the source,"If you want to be enthralled by the story of the Essex, go to the source -- any one of the printings of Essex first mate Owen Chase's first-hand account in his ""Wreck of the Whaleship Essex"".His narrative takes you on the ship and grips you with the terror these men must have felt, adrift at sea with little food or water.Philbrick's retelling of the story doesn't capture the detail as well as one who was actually there.However, if you're looking for a history lesson on whaling, this one's not bad."
744,2,No up to expectations,"The book was alleged to be ""new"" but the cover showed considerable wear. I think it was probably read and then offered for sale as ""new""."
745,2,To many comparisons for a real story,"You can't tell is a great story when the story is real, here the writer tells us a real story and he writes things to compare the reality of that story with other stories, if you are writing a real story you don't have to compare it with anything, just tell the story and that's it.In the other hand your will read many times that it was a sunny day, then a rainy day, the a storm day, you just get tired of reading the same in all the chapters.In the main story you will learn that when happened a human tragedy, this tragedy is because were made several errors, not just one, and that was what happened to this crew.For ME, the last chapter is the epilogue and the epilogue doesn't have to be written."
746,4,Excellent read,"I found this to be one of the most engaging books I have read in a long time. I read it in three nights and was sad when it was over. The author appears to have done a LOT of research on this subject, amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book. It's great to read a book that is both well-researched and well-written. My only complaint, a small one, is that I wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew. Unlike some authors, Philbrick definitely didn't ignore this topic. But when the African-American members of the boats die off and are eaten, one by one, I was totally incredulous. How could this have happened? I thought Philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved. Perhaps, however, there really wasn't enough data to go on. Anyway, as I said, I greatly enjoyed this book."
747,3,Call Me Disapointed,"I enjoyed ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" for about 200 pages, the first 3/4 of the book which is your basic stranded/survival story. Once the survivors are rescued, Philbrick loses his storytelling ability. Characters stumble all over each other in a confusing mismash. Even Philbrick's writing gets worse in the last 50 pages; there are several sentences towards the end of this book that are simply incomprehensible."
748,5,Whale Bites Ship,"This was a compelling story that kept me interested until the last page. Nathanial Philbrick told me more than I ever wanted to know about whaling in the early 19th century and the tragedy of the Essex. The actual sinking of the ship by a sperm whale is stunning enough, but the tale of survival by the crew members was even more remarkable. I would recommend this book to anyone."
749,5,a great story well-told and well-researched,"This is a great nautical introduction for the landlubber. Philbrick does a great job of telling the straight story of Nantucket, of whaling, of this journey, of what happened to the men, and of what happened to their legend.Philbrick especially does a great job of filling-in-the-blanks when the historical record is thin. When the men are adrift with minimal food for weeks, he uses WWII-era experiments to speculate what probably happened to the men's physiology and psychology. He interviews contemporary whale experts to evaluate the likelihood of the reputed whale behavior.Overall, a great story well-told and well-researched, and deserving of the National Book Award. It inspired me to make a trip to the New Bedford Whaling museum!"
750,5,worthy of the award,"I read this book a couple of years ago, but scenes from the novel, masterfully painted by Nathaniel Philbrick, are still with me. Few books in my life have engaged me as this one did. It's the kind you just want to recommend to whomever you can, because you know they're going to enjoy it also. I know this all sounds like hyperbole, but Philbrick, in my opinion, is a gifted writer. He expertly describes the events taking place, and as I was reading I was also making the movie in my head. I think it would be a fantastic movie (unless hollywood ruins it of course).A MUST read."
751,5,In the Heart of the Sea,"Was great,It put you right there with those poor soles,that went through that terrible ordeal.I learned a lot about that time and place also.It was a quick read"
752,3,Worthwhile read for true account fans,"First let me say I am a big fan of survival against all odds types of books. I have read and loved Alive, Forever on the Mountain, In Harms Way, etc. This would not rank up to those standards in my opinion. Of course those three books I mentioned had a big advantage - actual survivors for the author to interview. This event took place in 1820 so the author had less to go on. All that being said, if you are a fan of survival books this is worthwhile. A 3 out 5 sounds right on."
753,4,Interesting Nantucket History,"Having read the Mayflower by Mr. Philbrick some time ago and knowing how he was motivated to write that book, it interested me as to his motivation for this book. I was not dissapointed as the book is through in facts and presentation. As you already know, his writing is very vivid and complete not leaving the reader constantly guessing or speculating as to what transpired. Also it was a selection for our Sailing Book Club which motivated us to read it. Glad we did."
754,4,Well Done,"Philbrick is a good writer. Sometimes I felt pulled between the history of Nantucket, an inside look into whaling and the story of the Essex. Each is interesting and deserves its own book. The story of the Essex is incredibly powerful, and I feel that Philbrick treated the terrible survival struggles of the crew at an arm's length. The details were there, just not the emotion. He came close, but this story - with the struggle, errors of judgment, tragedy and cannibalism, had the potential to stand with the classic tales of Bly or Shackleton, but this telling didn't quite deliver."
755,4,"Good Book, Made Me Nauseated","I enjoyed reading this book. However, it did make me nauseated. Author goes into a lot of detail."
756,5,one of the best maritime disaster books I've ever read,"What a fantastic story told in a fascinating way. I've read many books about maritime disasters, and this one has gone to the top of the list. Nathaniel Philbrick is a great story-teller and meticulous researcher. I'm very, very impressed."
757,5,Whale of a book,"One fantastic book! Expertly written and researched, Heart of the Sea is a must. I read it in one day. Absorbing. Don't miss it. And give it to the children, too."
758,5,How does this novel stack up with the Penguin Version?,"I haven't read this book, but I was wondering how this book stacks up with the Penguin version 'The Loss of the Whale Ship Essex, Sunk By A Whale?' From what I understand, this novel is a retelling of events while the Penguin Classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members? I'm a bit torn as to which one I should read/purchase. All comments are very much appreciated."
759,5,Stunning Tale of Old Whaling Days,I just finished this last night...wow! The narration is lively and keeps the pace of the story while the author imparts a great deal of information that could have been dull but is not. The prose is so vivid that I could not eat while reading the passages about dismembering the whale; I could almost smell the burning oil and feel the slick decks. Amazing that men made a living this way! I can hardly wait to start Philbrick's MAYFLOWER.
760,5,Best book I've read in the last 5 years,"This is a great peice of work. Nathaniel Philbrick uses a wonderful, empathetic style when telling this tragic story. If you like history, adventure, and sailing you may want to read this one twice."
761,1,False Advertising,"I ordered a hardcopy of this book and was sent a paperback. The seller did not even have a hardcopy in stock event though the item description explicitly said that it was a hardcopy. Had to send it back, waiting for refund - this is a hassle and I still don't have what I wanted."
762,5,"The ""Demos"" CD plus two tracks","Margo Guryan fans, take note : This CD consists of the same material as the ""Demos"" CD on another label, right down to the running order and some of the liner notes. It does include two extra tracks (""Why Do I Cry?"" and ""Under My Umbrella"", neither written by Guryan) tacked on the end, though, so if you don't already have the ""Demos"" CD, this is now the better choice. As far as the music goes : Excellent! Although these tracks are demos, the arrangements are unexpectedly full (strings, woodwinds, backing vocals) and could easily pass as finished commercial recordings. Guryan's vocals are as charmingly ethereal as always and she has a rare gift for melody and nuance in her songwriting. Although many of the songs overlap with those on the terrific ""Take a Picture"", many are heard here in quite different arrangements, making this an essential purchase for fans."
763,3,"Decent Info, But there is better out there","The author of this book surely has a lot of experience with veneering, but in my opinion there are better ways to do things than some of the ways he suggests. For instance he uses regular wood glue (PVA) to apply veneer by letting it dry and then using an iron to reactivate the glue. I would never trust this to hold over the long run and PVA glue is not the best kind of glue to use with veneer anyway. It is to thin and it doesn't dry to a hard glue line so it will allow the veneer to creep with seasonal changes in humidity. He also never mentions using a vacuum press. While a press might not be for beginners, it is the easiest, best way to veneer a flat or curved panel."
764,4,Very Good Tutorial,"Nice, relaxed writing style. Good information for anyone interested in learning about veneering from the ground up."
765,4,Almost Five Stars,"This is a really, really good book. The format is excellent (color photos, well organized) and he covers all of the important topics including flattening veneer, substrates, shop-made equipment and of course, cutting and fitting veneer.However, there is a big gap in his coverage: the use of a vacuum press.I've used a vacuum press numerous times and have excellent results. Mr. Barton, on the other hand, has never wanted to make the capital investment (~$700) in a quality vacuum press and consequently a lot of his projects didn't go well. Because he didn't have success with a retrofitted vacuum cleaner and thin plastic bags (both are inadequate for the task), he ignores a very useful tool."
766,4,"Quick ship, good product","Good product. Purchased the same once before so I knew what I was getting. If I can get something that works for me and pay half the cost of a famous name brand, I'll certainly do it. Was shipped quickly as usual. What more can be said about this product, ahhh, not too much. Thanks amazon.com ."
767,1,Generic Anti-gas,"This product did not work for me. Even though the active ingredients are the same as name brands, the formulation seems to be different. For the price, you might want to try a bottle to see if it will work for you."
768,3,Mommy of One....,"We received this toy as a Christmas gift when my daughter was 17 months old. She loves playing with it & can easily pop the parts together.My only suggestion is that this toy should be purchased along with a larger group of Pop-Onz toys.By itself, there's not a lot you can do, but along with other pieces, it's great."
769,2,boring,"This toy is very durable with brigh colors, but this toy is also quite lame!!! There is nothing to do besides popping the animals on and of of the other plastic pieces. We received this toy as a gift, and the only thing it has proved itself good for, is a teether (the different pieces) to our daughter."
770,4,Impressive first effort,"""Almayer's Folly"" adequately introduces the theme of culture conflict, an angle that is expressed more fully in Conrad's later works. I would certainly recommend this to anyone familiar with Conrad's body of work, which is not to say that readers new to his work should avoid this novel."
771,3,Almayer's rut,"An alternative title for this novel could be Amayer's rut.For that is the situation that the main protagonist in this novel finds himself in. Almayer is a European trader living in atrading post somewhere in Indonesia or Malaysia with his daughter,a product of mixed marriage.Almayer dreams of escaping to Europe after making himself wealthy and bringing his daughter with him also.But as time drags on it becomes obvious that he is going nowhere with his life. He is not getting richer nor is he getting any younger. His own daughter ends up deserting him by eloping with a native who takes her to his own village.Not being a pure European by blood she realizes that she would never be accepted as an equal among Europeans or the whites.For this reason she chooses instead to live with the natives.As for Almayer he remains as he was.He is an example that one can find everywhere in the world.Someone stuck in a situation going nowhere but always dreaming of getting out and changing his life."
772,4,A Great First Novel,"As this is Conrad's first novel, it is not fair to expect the sort of power that illuminates his later works. However, Almayer's Folly is a good, solid novel which shows the potential for Conrad's later greatness. A love story at its heart, Almayer's Folly also provides a last look at classical imperialism and the crossroads of multiple cultures. A short novel, I would heartily recommend it."
773,4,Nice Tracy and Hepburn Film,This is a disarming little movie about a woman athlete and her coach. It is a somewhat romantic comedy but it is more about developing a female athlete and coaching her to be a winner. Katherine Hepburn was apparently a terrific athlete and Garson and Kanin wrote their screenplay around her. It is not a raccuous or exaggerated romantic comedy like Adam's Rib or even Woman of the Year. It is much smaller but very charming. Take it for what it is and don't expect it to be like the other films. This is not what Pat and Mike are about.
774,3,Chemstry101.,"I've seen eight of the nine Hepburn-Tracy movies & Pat & Mike makes the first bracket, as do all the comedies. The least of them is better than any of the dramas the two stars did. Cherce. Pat is an all-seasons atheletically gifted amateur. Mike is a slightly bent promoter who sees her as his meal ticket. She really doesn't do the cause of women any favors in this one. She's totally flustered & befuddled with her boyfriend, which is part of the plot & listens to & obviously has great affection for Mike. Light but not bad. There are also cameos of golfers & tennis pros of the era."
775,3,For the Hepburn/ Tracy fans,A comedy almost classic. I am more disapointed in this multi pro cameo line up with Katheryn in awe playing with them. Her tennis and golf swings are amusing to watch as the balls dribble off to the sides. Watch this when you are bored and cann't sleep.
776,3,Two Pros at Work Here,"Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made many pictures together during their long romance, and ""Pat and Mike"" is a pretty good one. Kate is a take-off of Babe Diedrikson, an all-around female athlete who is currently a golf championship contender. Spence is the Damon Runyon type who lines himself up as her manager/trainer. Much of the comedy in the piece comes from the disconnect between ""dese,dem, and dose"" Spence and high school teacher Kate trying to seek common ground. Plot device similar to the later ""Desk Set"" where the Kate character is smitten with a guy who's just not good enough, until she comes to her senses and accepts Spence as her lover. Check it out."
777,3,Hepburn Takes Control,"Pat and Mike must have gotten a lot of attention when it came out in the early Fifties, since it has a strong message about relying on yourself and women being equal to men and doing more than their traditional role. Hepburn and Tracy are both very good in their roles as sportswoman and manager. Aldo Ray, as a boxer who may have had too many shots to the head, has a lot of funny moments that liven up the film. The movie has a great message, but the laughs aren't as strong as I was expecting, and although I enjoyed it, the film is not at the same level as a lot of the other Hepburn/Tracy films. But I'm sure their fans will like it."
778,5,Astonishing contrasts,"Having heard a live performance of Eight Seasons given by Tasmin Little at De La Warr pavilion,Bexhill was enthusiastic to get a copy. The performance by Gidon Kremer does not disappoint. The Vivaldi is as fresh as ever, far less mannered than the Nigel Kennedy version, and with the revolutionary 'naturalistic' effects of the seasons that make it so endearing a piece played with sensitivity and grace. The Piazzola 4 Seasons of Buenos Aires is similarly responsive to the atmospheres of the city but composed with amazing a-tonal effects. Huge glissandi and sonorous climaxes along with cool, lazy tango rhythms make a complete musical portrait of the sounds of the city. Very exciting music making - very rewarding listening"
779,2,"Ara Malikian's ""No Seasons"" is the new reference","If you wish to hear the best audiophile version of Piazzolla's Four Seasons, now you have the chance to do it with the new work of Ara Malikian int the album ""No Seasons"" with the Non Profit Music Chamber Orchestra. Search for it in Amazon."
780,5,Rapturous,"Parts of this recording are so beautiful that when I listen while working, I have to pause what I am doing and close my eyes. I don't remember how I ended up buying this CD (it certainly wasn't planned), but I am so grateful.My rabbit hates it though. When I listen to it at home, he stamps his feet. So I can only listen to it at work. :("
781,5,Wish they still made it,"This mower used to be made by Agri-Fab, but they stopped producing it. I have one and it is awesome. The blade spins freely, so it doesn't have very much resistence when pushing. All the other Great States / American Lawnmower Company mowers that I know of have contact blades, which dull quickly and make the mower difficult to push. I would check out Sunlawn mowers if I were planning to buy another reel mower."
782,5,Hotheads are HOT!,"SNZ and BBVD are good, but these guys from Minneapolis smoke! In no way are the Hotheads latecomers to the ""swing scene;"" they owe more to the wilder, dirtier jazz of the late 20s. This is actually their third album, with two prior albums (and some minor changes with musicians) as the Straw Dogs. Check it out...you won't be disappointed!"
783,3,Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings,"Bought these recently when Amazon was running a special of $15.00 off on the price and free shipping...So I only paid $14.99 for these earrings. When I received them I was taken by how pretty they were, but couldn't figure out if they were white stones or blue! The blue topaz in these earrings was so light that they looked almost like white stones. In that I was disappointed, but in everything else very pleased. A value at $14.99 but I would not have paid $29.99 for these earrings with the poor stone color. Problem is: you don't know until you get them!"
784,1,Too Thick to Wear!,"This was a case of you get what you pay for! The price was excellent but the stones are barely a blue color at all - not very pretty. Additionally, I am not able to wear them because the metal prong that is supposed to go through your ear is so thick (I don't wear earrings all the time, so the holes in my ears are not stretched out at all!) I was unable to get it through my ears!"
785,2,Not Blue Topaz...,"I purchased these earrings for myself, and when they arrived I knew right away they did not look like blue topaz. They are a very pale blue, and look like aquamarine instead. Also, the posts are unusually wide, and are difficult, and somewhat painful, to insert in the ear if you're used to the more common thin posts."
786,1,How did this get so many + reviews?!,"I really am confused in why this item got so many positive reviews?! Perhaps I just got a dud?! Blue topaz is my birhtstone, and seeing the size of these, I thought these would be the perfect kind of earrings to put in and forget about....Mind you, I own many blue topaz pieces...but these were barely blue at all! And the silver pieces in between the stones? Well, it just blended the stones in even more to a washed out faded look! Seriously, I couldnt even tell these were blue topaz.Unfortunately, these went back. I wanted blue topaz, not some pale whitish stones..."
787,3,Nice looking but lots of fingerprints to clean off,"I ordered this product over the weekend and it arrived on Tuesday. Very fast delivery and the unit looks nice.I am kind of disappointed that every time you touch the microwave stainless steel it leaves fingerprints and I have already had to clean it twice a day. That will ultimately drive me nuts.Also, I am not sure why but the carousel sometimes makes a loud grinding noise and I do not find anything in the manual to explain why this is. I am going to try to see if I can level it better and see if that helps but it is kind of weird when it makes this grinding noise. It doesn't do it everytime but only on occasion and I cannot figure out why."
788,3,they are ok!,they are a brilliant shoe although they can be loose.the front strap is a little too thin but it works.! I recommend this shoe to teens ages 15 and above!!
789,3,if you like martha,a good entertaing book for martha stewart fans only. a lighthearted book. all stories could be more
790,1,One of her worst - a cut & paste job,This is old articles from her magazine and the advice was not very good. There are better books.
791,4,Treat your relationships like the work of art they can be,"Funny, smart, erudite, Steve Chandler affirms that our biggest and most powerful erogenous zone is our brain. Chandler deflates the myth that love just happens---true love, whether of a friend or a spouse or a pet, is cultivated and created, over and over again. Great stuff."
792,4,It has helped me,"A couple years ago the author of this book (who didn't know me, nor I him) sent me a free copy. I have no idea why......but I am thankful now that he did. It sat on my shelf for about two years. But I eventually picked it up with the desire to become more ""relationship oriented.""The chapters are nice and short -- they can be ingested in about twenty minutes. That's very convenient for me. He also does a fine job making profound relationship-truths simple to understand.This books has been a great help to me.Like a little seed that Steve planted in my life, it is now shooting up and bringing forth good fruit.Thanks for the book, Steve!"
793,3,not so flexible,"Depends on your preference, but i found these gloves to be not flexible enough to feel comfortable. The leather linings are the ones causing this.. The item description matches the real product. However, note that it says on the puma package that it is 'goalkeeper gloves' - but looking at how they are made, these are definitely not good for goalkeeping (but it is understandable for these gloves to be as inflexible if they are to be for goalkeeping.) Also, if you are in cold climate these pairs won't protect you from getting cold."
794,1,You've got to be kidding,"John Rewald,you should be ashamed.$400 for a lousy 50 color plates(I live in Australia,and it sells for $650).If you're going to put out a catalogue raisonne of an artist,you should have the majority of the works in color,no-one wants to look at b/w reproductions anymore.You just have to compare this with the magnificent catalogue raisonne's on Rothko,Gauguin and Sargent,to see how this work falls short.A major dissappointment."
795,4,A partially great collection of music,"Plumb started out with a sound to really grab you. As the band has grown (and now changed to just a single person), the sound has matured. This collection is a good overview of some of their better songs. If you've never heard Plumb, this is an ok start, but I'd suggest just skipping it and going straight for CandyCoatedWaterDrops instead. Half of the songs on this collection are from that release, and it's worth owning. Still, the radio hits (""Stranded"", ""Here With Me"") are on this disc, and the price can't be beat."
796,5,from the editor of the book,"I appreciate the favorable comments made by all of the reviewers. For the record, however, in response to Peter George: my note on Stonewall Jackson accurately observes that the Confederate forces under his command repulsed the Union army at the first Bull Run and forced their retreat to Washington. I elsewhere add (chapter V, note 14) that J. E. Johnston commanded all Confederate forces in the battle. Peter Bridges also seems to object that my notes are too detailed, even ""demeaning"" to ""educated Penguin readers,"" yet that my note re. Bailie Jarvie is not detailed enough. I can only reply that my notes are intended to aid precisely those undergraduates who require them, not the pedants who are perfectly entitled to ignore them."
797,4,A great civil war novel.,"Written shortly after the end of the Civil War this novel covers all of the bases -- politics, battles, social issues, and personal relationships -- affected by the war. It does this with a depth not usually seen in Civil War novels and particularly those written in the 20th century. De Forest does not insult the reader's intelligence and his characters are not just stereotypes but have real flesh and blood. (Well, except maybe for the heroine!) If you enjoy this book try A Fool's Errand for a good novel about Reconstruction also written shortly after the end of the Civil War."
798,2,works only at times,"This product seems to work whenever it feels like it. Loses connection often and is really slow. I had trouble updating my Tivo with this. Ended up just connecting it to the internet directly. Although that meant having the TV at a different location than I wanted, it just wasn't worth the hassle."
799,5,Seamless set up,I decided to drop my land line only to realize that my Tivo was now very unhappy! I checked out several options for providing wireless connectivity and decided to go with this one. Good choice. It was a breeze to setup and has operated very reliably so far - a couple of months at this point.
800,4,"Glacial shipping, good product",love the wireless adapter but...it kills me that Newegg can have the same product at my house in 2 days with free shipping but it takes Amazon 2 WEEKS. Buhbye amazon
801,4,Works as expected,works fine..connects to my wireless network and doesn't tie up the phone line when downloading. no complaints..
802,5,A definite must have for Tivo owners,I live outside the US in Bermuda and having my Tivo connect through my phone lines was costing me a small fortune in international calls. I bought the Tivo network adaptor and plugged it in. Within minutes it had automatically configured itself to my network and now I download all my Tivo updates through the internet which costs me nothing. I am very pleased with this purchase. It was very simple to install and once running you can simply forget about it.
803,4,Set it and forget it,"The TiVo wireless adapter is easy to install: plug it into the back of your TiVo and you're ready to go. My only difficulty was in getting it to agree with myLinksys WRT55AG Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point + Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch, which seems like a common configuration. It was a frustrating half an hour before I was able to get everything to play nicely together. (The detection process wasn't as easy as I thought it would be in this plug and play era.) You definitely need to know how your network is set up and be prepared to play with your wireless network configuration application.That said, once I got everything working correctly, the thing has been extremely easy to use: in fact, I haven't had to do anything to it since we put it in. The additional TiVo features that come with always-on access may appeal to some; for us, knowing that we can remotely program a show in a short time frame and still catch it is pretty cool."
804,5,TiVo wireless adapter,If you can't connect your TiVo using an Ethernet cord then this is the next best thing. This is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a TiVo. This adapter was specifically design for TiVo.
805,4,best wireless for Tivo,"The build quality is incredible on this. It feels, well, as good as it's price. Yes, it's a pricy g wireless adapter, but it's integration into the Tivo console and speed are worth it. My room to room transfers are not much faster right now, but I understand that will improve when I get the other Tivo on one of these. I've been using wireless adapter/bridges on my Tivos and having to configure them seperatly sucks. I love how the Tivo can setup this wireless adapter as if it were integrated. I wish it was N, but my network is not N either so it's a moot point.I think the only thing better would be to hard wire your Tivo into the network."
806,5,Works like a charm,I hooked it up and it worked immediately...no problems and it was quite a bit cheaper than ordering the exact same thing from Tivo
807,5,TiVO just gets better!,"I ordered a new TiVO box for my living room and then realized I'd have to run some cables which I wasn't looking forward to. I checked the web site and discovered that I could go wireless. This little gem is worth its weight in platnum! I was concerned that it might not work well but I was very wrong. We have three TiVO boxes and now all of them are wireless. I HIGHLY recomend this product. It looks nice and sort of blends into any room. It's easy to install and comes with everything you need. (except a wireless ""g"" router and the TiVO box)Buy with confidence."
808,4,TiVo to the next level,"These TiVo adapters work great and take TiVo to the next level. Having a TiVo network has been great for scheduling, watching shows from other TiVo's in the house and downloading movies and shows from Amazon.If you are a TV fan and love your TiVo, you will appreciate it even more once you buy the adapters and set up a home network!"
809,5,Great Extra for Tivo!,"This thing works really well. It's a little slow but that's Comcast's fault, because their internet service sucks! But this Item is pretty cool and works great too!"
810,3,"Somewhat hard to set up, but now works great!","When I set up my TiVo for wireless service, rather than corded, I struggled to set it up. I eventually had to contact TiVo support (who were very friendly and helpful). There were issues with my wireless security settings which conflicted with the TiVo. Once we figured the correct security setting, the wireless adapter worked flawlessly and we have had no problems since! Worth the purchase, however, expect that setting it up may be a challenge (although it may not be depending on your security settings!) I believe at the time we were using WPA security."
811,5,Love it - and generally get 80% reception,"I would have to use a phone connection for Tivo without this adapter because my broadband source is several rooms away and I'm not going to run ethernet cable through the apartment. The phone works, but generally it only connects once in the middle of the night. With a broadband connection Tivo will connect more frequently at all times of the day - among several other advantages.Techno-novices take note: you must have a wireless router to make use of this adapter, but if your TV is close to a wired ethernet source (as was the case at my old house) you do not need this!Be sure to go into your settings and see what % connectivity you're getting - I went from less than 60% up to 79/80% with a slight change in the angle of the hinged portion and where I positioned the device. It's quite small so it takes up very little room."
812,5,Works great,"We have two of these, used to network our Series 2 and Series 3 Tivos. Easy to set up and use, have had no problems in the 8 months we've been using 'em (and LOVE being able to stream from Netflix!)"
813,5,no more phone line,"This adapter is great. I no longer have to connect to the TIVO service with a telephone line. By connecting through my broadband, I have a lot more options on how to use my service. Set up was easy, and reception is excellent."
814,4,Easy,Works just as described. Plugged it in and the TIVO found my new wireless network and was communicating in just a few minutes. Significantly less expensive here than on the TIVO site.
815,5,Easy as pie,"Just unpackage it, plug into the back of the TIVO box, and TIVO does the rest (prompts you to change to your wireless router). Simple."
816,5,Easy! Love it!,Easy as pie to hook up and works in a jiff! Great connection and I couldn't be happier with it!
817,5,great price,The Adapter works great with my new HD Tivo and was $30 cheaper than one I bought at Best Buy for my older Series 3.
818,5,A Tivo Series 3 Must,"When we purchased the Series 3 Tivo I had to upgrade the wireless adapter from the one I had used with a Series 2 Tivo. Installation was a snap and it has worked flawlessly. It is absolutly essential in order to view Netflix videos as easy as it is to watch an old TIVO recording. Networking to a computer it makes it possible to transfer programs between TIVO units, transfer programs to your computer, and to publish photos and music from you computer to your TV."
819,4,Great Purchase,Installed in seconds. Great performance. Excellent to eliminate phone line dependency.
820,5,Tivo Wireless G USB adapter,Love it! It was easy to setup and connect to my home network with no problems. It also works with my WAP encryption enabled.
821,4,Tivo Wireless Great!,B4 I purchased this device I had a phone wire wrapped from my computer to the phone jack and a lot of clutter. Now there are no wires and no clutter. The Tivo wireless device works like a charm. You plug it in and it does the rest. Simple. Love it!
822,5,Great Buy,Bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted. Worked right out of the box. Very good product.
823,4,TiVO Wireless G,"I had some problems with my TiVO not taking PWA2 at first but once my system finally updated, 2 days later, I have been enjoying not having to many wires running around in the room. Go wireless, it is great!"
824,3,Covers the basics,"So far this thing is giving me trouble. It will keep your programming up to date with out issue, but after that it will take some effort to get other features working right. Multi room viewing and usage of TIVO desktop seem to require rebooting the box from time to time."
825,3,TIVO Wireless adapter works!,"This product worked perfectly and can be used during initial TIVO service setup (no phone-line required); it is the ""G"" standard and handles WAP security without issue. Unfortunately, the TIVO service was impracticable to set-up, so I returned this with the DVR."
826,4,Worth it,"The adapter works very well. I spent a long time trying to find a compatible adapter for my Tivo but none of the available adapters worked. This one is worth the money and it hasn't caused me a single problem yet. It gets excellent range, requires no set up, and has a great connection. Well worth it."
827,1,Signal too weak,"Our wireless router is upstairs on one end of the house, and the TiVo is downstairs on the opposite end of the house. Even so, when using laptops while watching television, the internal WiFi cards manage to get a ""Fair"" to ""Good"" signal. Even my 5 year old iPAQ gets a workable signal at that location.But, the TiVo AG0100 Wireless G adapter could manage a ""Poor"" connection at best. It could work, sort of, but only intermittently.Faced with either using a repeater or wiring the TiVo directly with CAT5, I chose the latter.[...]"
828,3,No benefit over phone line for us,We used the phone line method for a year before getting this. I would say that we've seen no benefit from switiching.I don't need to listed to music on the tv and the photos look worse than on my laptop. Movies are more expensive to download than Netflix. The stuff that is free such as youtube like clips is more of a hassle to view than by going to it directly on the computer.Other people's experience and setup may vary.
829,5,Easy to use and Makes TiVo even better!,"As others have said, this product is very easy to set up. We use it with our Series 2 Duel Tuner Tivo. Now that we're set up on the wireless network we can go to Tivo's website and schedule TV shows for our TiVo to record. We also downloaded TiVo to Go. The wireless adaptor allows us to send recorded programs from our TiVo to our computers (which can then be viewed or transfered to an ipod video or burned on DVD). The wireless adapter also allows us to listen to our favorite podcasts on the TV (this is a feature of the TiVo service), listen to the music we have saved on our computer through our TV and view pictures saved on our computer through the TV. Not bad for price."
830,4,Works great and looks great,All the other statements are true about download speed due to its ability to help in decompressing data. However I have a Mac and you can't do Tivo to Go but over all I think it is very helpful no matter what and I just bought another one for my S3. God Bless Tivo
831,5,Excellent Wireless Adapter for TIVO,"I've gone through two other adapters, one being DLink which constantly loss the connection or couldnt see my network, this adapter works great. Installation was nothing: you just connect to TIVO and run the network install, the adapter found the network and settings on its own.Highly recommend this one."
832,5,Absolutely Perfectly Quick and Easy,"We plugged in our Tivo box, and realized that we needed a phone line plugged in to obtain up-to-date program guides. Unfortunately, our phone line was all the way on the opposing corner of the room. We couldn't leave the line plugged in, strewn across the floor, so we would routinely have to plug in a phone cord, let it update, then unplug it again. We saw that Tivo had this Wireless USB adapter, but found it much cheaper on Amazon. We plugged it in, Tivo recognized it, we followed the onscreen prompts, and tada!! Couldn't been simpler! An added perk is that, when we bought additional ones for other rooms, not only to we never have to worry about tying up the phone line, but we now have all the Tivo units networked together, so if we record something in the living room, we can watch it in the bedroom! How cool is that! I would recommend this to everyone who has Tivo and a wireless network setup in their house."
833,5,It works,I was looking for a way to connect to tivo without using a phone line. Tivo does not support phone service over Cable so I needed to invest in another way to connect. This is easy to hook up and works well. Amazon had the best price I could find.
834,5,TIVO Wireless adapter,"I was dragging a 75 ft telephone cord up to my TIVO every 10 days or so. Most of the time it could not make a connection. If it did make a connection, it failed to complete download. It was ridiculous.It would call 5-6-7 times and I had to have this cord laying around until it was successful. It took 10 minutes to hook up the adapter to my wireless DSL upstairs. Now, I don't ever think about it. What took me so long!!!!"
835,4,Wireless works,"Tivo Wireless G USB Nework Adapter for Tivo Series 2 works great. I have two tivo's which this allowed me to link so I can record different shows and watch them in either room and don't have to have wires everywhere. I like it, no love it. The price on amazon was about 20% cheaper than in stores I looked at. I would recommend if you have the need and interest."
836,5,Very good value.,"The TiVo AG0100 wireless adapter is quite a distance from my router but I get fantastic and fast data transfer. The product was very easy to install, it took about 3 minutes."
837,5,Almost flawless operation!,"My husband and I recently purchased a Series 3 HD Tivo and ordered this to avoid having to go the phone line connection route. This adapter works really well with strong signal strength!One issue...I was listening to Pandora one day and it was skipping like a CD (and this happened again another day). I couldn't get it to stop so I just turned it off. I called Tivo's customer service to see why this may be happening, and they said to try unplugging it for 15 seconds and then reconnecting it. This fixed the issue for the moment. They said it's usually a network issue. However, I don't believe it's an issue with my network (as I never have problems with it), and that this adapter sometimes gets off track somehow. I guess I will continue to troubleshoot this way. Overall, it's an excellent product that has a small glitch every now and then. Aside from that, we haven't had any problems with streaming Video on Demand or regular recorded TV."
838,4,tivo usb adapter,It has made my life a lot easier since giving up on those remote phone jacks for me tivo connections. Now I dont have to make a connection every 5-7 days or at all unless there has been a real power outage or router difficulty.what a joy
839,4,Tivo wireless,It works. The walls and distance between devices in my house pretty much dont let anything below wireless G cards and devices get reception but this gets like 78% signal. Definitely not as fast as going with the wired option though. I'd recommend.
840,5,Wireless Adapter--Awesome!,Love being able to connect to any of the TiVos in my home from any one of them. It's a great product.
841,5,Works exactly as advertised!,There is little to say about this little item apart from the fact that it makes life with a TiVo DVR even easier and your connections and downloads much faster. Works exactly as described and is a total breeze to install. It looks very low profile and sleek and is small enough to sit anywhere (and disappear) in your a/v set up. Superb product.
842,3,Worked well but was a huge bandwidth hog.,"This item was super easy to set up using the on screen instructions. But holy cow. What a bandwidth hog. Once I'd plugged it in the thing was constantly contacting the TIVO mother ship. My whole internet connection slowed down while the TIVO wireless was contacting TIVO which it did nearly constantly. Also, it downloaded tons of advertisements that I didn't get when I'd only used the regular dial up updating for TIVO. So, I have mixed emotions about this product. On one hand it did exactly what it said it would. It updated my TIVO and it was easy to install. On the other hand I ended up disconnecting it just so that it would quit feeding my TIVO advertisements and would quit hogging my bandwidth."
843,5,Works well with WPA2,"I wanted to upgrade my older TiVo-compatible 802.11b Linksys wireless adapter to 54g to get faster transfers between my TiVo Desktop, so, at first, I tried the IOGear 54g USB wireless adapter which I already owned, but it seems that TiVo has made sure that its box will only work (or work best) with its own branded wireless adapter (its website says that the AG0100 is the only one that will support WPA security).If you can get past their marketing extortion and bite the bullet, this attractive adapter works like a gem. I have the popular Linksys Wireless-G broadband router and configured it to use WPA2 security. While the TiVo website only mentions support for WPA for the AG0100, I did not have an issue with compatibility. I simply plug it in, entered my network password, and it connected with a strong signal."
844,4,This item is great,"We ordered 2 of these for our 2 series 2 tivo's and so far, we have not had one hitch in the system. These are super easy to install, they pick up the network quickly and they have worked well so far.i recommend spending the extra money to buy the Tivo brand. it's more money, but less hassel and more satisfaction."
845,5,"Works great, not that simple to install!","This is a great wireless device. The only thing that gave me a hard time was trying to connect it. I had to go into my Wireless router and change the settings from WAP to WEP encrytion. But once that was taken care of, it worked great."
846,5,Tivo wireless adapter,"Great product, works extremely well. My modem is in my basement and the adapter is upstairs. I get an 85% signal strength. Highly recommend."
847,5,Thank Goodness For TIVO,"This TIVO Network Adapter is the ONLY way to go to set up your TIVO. I have my TIVO in my bedroom set up with one of these and my computer is at the other end of the house. I have a Linksys wireless router on my computer and this USB works perfectly!! I have two walls in between the wireless router and the TIVO in the bedroom and it connects to the TIVO service every time. Don't waste your money on other USB Adapters, I did and I had a very hard time getting my previous USB adapter ( a linksys USB adapter) to connect to my network. As soon as I hooked up this little baby to my network...BAM....I was connected. You will not be disappointed with this USB. Trust Me!"
848,5,Works great with Tivo Premier,"I bought the wireless adapter to pair up with Tivo Premier. Talk about piece of cake! I took the adapter out of the package, plugged it into the USB in the back of the Tivo, ran the wireless setup and was up and running. Just be aware there are two versions of the adapter; one for wireless A/B/G and the another for N."
849,1,not too compatible with iMac,"the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network. When Tivo worked on the network, my printer didn't. It was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in."
850,2,None,Couldn't get the device to work with my network so it just sits there useless.Vendor exceeded delivery expectations!
851,3,TiVo G Network Adapter,"Works great, I look for this item many different place and Amazom had the best price."
852,1,wasted my money,I spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network. Went through the steps a bazillion times . It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!
853,4,SAVED $$ WITH AMAZON,TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter for TiVo Series2 & Series3 DVRsthis works great!We purchased from Amazon and saved almost $30.00 it was $60.00 at Radio Shack for same exact thing.
854,4,Wireless is the way to go!,"This little gizmo works as promised. It's great if you want to transfer shows from one TV to another in your house. You can also download programs to your laptop providing you have TiVo to Go Plus. I'll never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again.It took me a little time to figure out that in the ""setting up"" stage of connecting your adapter, you weren't supposed to enter the router's password but rather the complicated encryption key."
855,5,Flawless Connection,"I was so thrilled with the easy of use for this USB product that I ordered a second one for my older Humax TiVo. I had previously conntected my Toshiba (w/CD Player) to the wireless router for my broadband network. I now have all three TiVo connected where they can ""see"" my router and now no telephone connections. This product worked immediately upon connecting to both my new HD Tivo and my very old Humax. i really enjoy the capability to transfer recordings from one TiVo to another because of the wireless connections."
856,5,TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter for TiVo Series 2 and Series 3 DVRs,"This product simply plugs into the TiVo, and it works like a charm, utilizing TiVo'z Internet capabilities including Netflix, Yahoo, YouTube, etc.Hopefully TiVo also will introduce a Wireless N as well as thie Wireless G adapter"
857,5,TiVo Wireless adapter,"Works right away, no configuration needed.... Just plug and play. Great price on Amazon too. Bestbuy sells this for twice as much!!"
858,3,Network Cable Disconnected Message With HD Tivo,"I ordered this to replace an older one that I thought had stopped working. I believe these work fine with the older series 2 Tivos but the HD Tivo seems to have a problem with the wireless. When we first got our HD box, we got a ""Network Cable Disconnected"" error so we exchanged it for a new one. That one worked for a while but has recently been getting the same message. We have restarted it several times with only spotty results. I don't think it's the adapter. Our old box connects immediately with both adapters. If you are thinking about Tivo HD with wireless be warned. I don't know if it's the physical USB port on the unit but there is something going on that prevents the HD box from reliably connecting."
859,5,Does the Job,"It was inconvenient to arrange a telephone line access where my TIVO is placed, so I bought this wireless adapter. With the additional download and installation of the PC software, I can access media residing on the home network. This was not a driving reason for the purchase - just a nice extra.Installation and use of the adapter couldn't be easier. It was nice to have something work first try.I cannot rate customer service since I had no occasion to use it."
860,4,Works.,"Easy installation. Tivo has a rating of reception, and I couldn't get it to go more than 50-58%. But it still works."
861,2,Disappointed...,"We purchased the HD Tivo DVR, which requires only this adapter to get the internet wirelessly. It sits next to my PS3, yet gets worse reception than it, and even my iPod's reception, only 2 rooms away from the wireless modem. Watching HD movies streaming from Netflix is nearly impossible, it pauses about every 3-4 minutes for about 7-10 seconds, completely losing you from the storyline of the movie. In order to come up with a different solution for better reception, we may have to scrap the antenna all together, wasting the $40 we just spent on it."
862,4,Tivo adapter,"I was very pleased with the ease it was to use Amazon. When I received the item, I did not scrutinize it. When my friend went to install it, he noticed a burned hole in the package similar to a cigarette burn. I do not smoke. I asked Amazon to replace the cord which was burned as well but said that they would replace the complete adapter but my friend used my camera wire to install. Amazon did give me credit and if my installer had not already installed the adapter with my camera cord, I would have replaced the complete set.It would have cost me more to have my friend come back to install it again."
863,5,Makes Life Easier,"Prior to using this gadget we strung a phone cord across our living room to connect our older model Tivo, several times a week. The only thing you really need to know before you buy this product is that it is not WPA compatible, you must set your network for WEP instead. Don't know what I just said? Check out the configuration of your network, and I hope it becomes clear."
864,5,Perfect for Access and Updating,"If you have a wireless connection at home, you need this now. basically, you plug and play - and enter your wireless network's password - and you will never worry about updating your TIVo again. Great reception - I have my wireless box upstairs and on the other side of the house, and the TIVO wireless receiver downstairs and on the other end of the house: no connectivity or throughput issues."
865,3,Adequate for downloading programing. Too slow for streaming video,"This adapter achieved my initial objective of connecting my TiVo to my router without having to string CAT5 cable. Installation was very easy and the adapter worked great for connecting to Tivo service and downloading programming guide. I ran into trouble when attempting to connect to my Netflix account however. The system would connect, but the adapter was not fast enough to support streaming video. The video would pause to reload the buffer every 30 seconds or so. I suspect the Wireless ""N"" adapter would avoid this issue."
866,4,"Lots of money, but works",I got this for my TiVo series 2 box so I could use a better method of network encryption other than WEP. Worked great for that. It's heavy enough that it doesn't fly around like other plastic type devices. Seems to be a bit expensive.
867,2,It works for WPA systems but signal sucks,The unit was very easy to install and was added to my home network with no problems. The ease of use is very good for this unit. I didn't have alot of options available since many wireless adapters were not compatible with my Tivo 2 dual tuner system. I am not using the standard encryption system for my network and am using WPA encrytion for my homenetwork. Tivo's usb adapter is the only one compatible.The signal is very weak whereas my other components in the same location using a wireless adapter read well into the 90-100% range.The tivo wireless was about 60-65%.Overall i am satisfied with the unit as there are no other good options at this time.
868,5,Don't forget your Tivo Wireless G Adapter!,"Don't forget the Tivo Wireless G USB Network Adapter. If you already have broadband internet access with a wireless network, you can transfer shows between your Tivo box and computer or laptop. The deal from Amazon saved me about 70% over the full retail price offered on the Tivo website. Get it, you won't regret this purchase either!!"
869,4,Works like a charm,"The Tivo wifi adapter works like a charm, no idea if others work as well, reports seem to indicate if you want full fucntion, use this one, I can't argue as it works. Yes, it's a bit pricey, great price at Amazon, but it sure appears to be a quality piece, it's heavy, well finished, and even has indicators on it to show status and activity."
870,5,Just Plug it in!,"This item works exactly as it says, just plug it in and the TiVo recognizes it right away. I bought a different brand before checking the TiVo compatibility chart, and it didn't work."
871,5,TiVo Series3 Compatible,"Just in case there are readers considering the new TiVo Series3 HD box, this TiVo Wireless G works with it too. Mine arrived today and I plugged it right in and in less than 5 seconds, the Series3 had it installed. Very slick the way that TiVo wireless install process works!"
872,5,Plug and Play,"Having never dabbled much in wireless connectivity for a computer, much less for my Tivo, I was a bit nervous when we moved to a house where I couldn't connect my Tivo directly into my router. All of my online research also indicated that the Tivo was pretty finicky when it came to wireless connectivity.With that in mind, I bypassed other wireless bridges and bought the Tivo version. I can't say for sure that the other bridges wouldn't have worked, but the Tivo one works nicely. I was pretty apprehensive, but I just plugged it into the back of my Series 2 Tivo. I just had to change a setting on my Tivo and enter my WEP (or is it WPA? I can never remember) password. Bingo - everything worked like a charm.It was easy - as easy as electronics stuff SHOULD be but never is."
873,4,It's a NIC,Works fine with little to no configuration or setup. On a tivo it works right out of the box.
874,5,"Slightly pricey, but works well without a hitch",After reading problems with other usb wi-fi adapters I thought that the additional $15 ( $25 for one obtained from CC or Best Buy versus $40 at Amazon) was well worth it if we did not have to hook up the TiVo to a telephone every night and IT was well WORTH it. Set up was easy and I have had no hitch for the past month. The router is upstairs 30 feet away and the signal strength is >80 %. Unless someone has time to get the wireless adapters locally and tinker with it and return it if it does not function ( what with the current gas prices) I would recommend getting this one. A better option would be using LAN link if the house was hardwired
875,4,Tivo Wireless USB - Plug and Play,I have had my Tivo for about four years now. Every two weeks I have had to plug a phone line into the box for updates. I could not just leave it connected because I had to run it from another room in the house. Needless to say this got old. I started looking at compatible adapters and none of the retail stores had any in stock every time I checked. I found Amazon had this one at a reasonable price compared to the alternatives.I connected the adapter to my Tivo right out of the box and it installed and found my wireless network. Plug and Play! This was nice and easy!
876,5,TIVO Wireless Adapter,"This wireless adapter works extremely well. I have used Linksys adapter with my TIVO, but the connectivity was poor and inconsistent. This device if very effective and looks nice!"
877,5,Important tip for this unit,"I've used the Tivo wireless adapter for a couple years on an older box with no problems. I hooked the PremierXL and TiVo wireless adapter up and put the Tivo box's MAC (Media Access Control) address into the router. I have to restrict my network using MAC addresses due to my location.Nothing happened, it could not find my network. Over and over.2 hours later I took the adapter off and looked at the bottom to see if it was the correct one. Well, what do I see there but a MAC address for the adapter. Duh.I added that back into to the routers approved MAC addresses-and it worked first time, right away.Lesson: don't forget the adapter has its own MAC address. And you will have to add it if you restrict your network to certain MAC addresses."
878,4,Easy To Install,"The unit works pretty well most of the time but sometimes looses wireless connection with my cable modem. My installation places the receiver one floor below the cable modem with about 60 feet between the modem and receiver. The best signal strength noted so far is about 40% or less. Placement of the receiver can be critical, when I first installed it no signal was received from the modem and I had to relocate it higher in the room to get a only a minimal signal but it did work."
879,5,Great addition to TIVO,Setup was a breeze. It took very little time for the setup and recognition of the adaptor by my computer. It updates with the Tivo server and links to my pictures very well. I'm going to link with my Rhapsody server tonight and don't anticipate any problems. Anyone having Tivo should use it to it's full potential by getting one of these.
880,5,TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Adaptor,"I installed this so that I could get my TiVo Hi Def unit to broadband wirelessly. So far, it works great. I have had no problems with the connection to my wireless router."
881,5,Worked like a charm!,I wish this little doohickey had been available the first time I set up my TiVo wirelessly! I originally used a Linksys adapter and spent probably 4 hours trying to get it to work. With the TiVo adapter you just plug it in and continue with the on screen set up. The box recognizes the adapter immediately!Well worth the $50 price tag.
882,5,works great easy to set up,I had this working in under 10 minutes and it works perfectly. Now we don't have a phone cord running across the floor!
883,5,Works great,"The TiVo Wireless Adapter works great. As far as setting it up and using it, there's really nothing to it - Just plug it in and tell your TiVo your wireless ID and Key (password)."
884,5,Basically a no-brainer,"I own two Series 2 TiVOs. Each one had a Linksys WUSB12 wireless network adapter (slowing my entire wireless network down to B speed).I did this:1. Took out the WUSB12 adapters2. Plugged in the TiVO Wireless G USB adapters3. Restarted both TiVOs, just to be safe4. Adjusted my Linksys router to Wireless-G mode (instead of Mixed mode)BAM. DONE. My TiVO-To-Go transfers were now over a gajillion percent faster. ""6 hours remaining"" became ""1 hour remaining"".I have no complaints."
885,5,"Fast, reliable, easy to set up","Had to get this when we canceled our land line. OK so it cost some money, but it let us get rid of the wire, and it works quickly.I was also concerned that it wouldn't be compatible with my wireless network since I run a WPA2 with long complex name and password. But it was a breeze to set up, it connected right away, and the steps getting there were fairly well explained.I'm thinking about getting one for my inlaws, to free up the clutter from their phone line as well."
886,4,Does the job,"Yes, this costs 2x as much as a non-Tivo wireless-g adapter, but it seems to be the only one that actually works reliably with a Tivo, and I get better signal strength than with my old Linksys. Plus, it looks and feels really high quality."
887,5,Works like a charm,"Absolutely foolproof setup - took about three minutes. I guess it could have taken four minutes if I'd had to try a different network password, but I got lucky and remembered it on the first try. Guess I should include the two minutes it took me to open the box, so I'll say six minutes, tops!"
888,5,Great job TIVO !!,"I was so thrilled when TIVO came out with this wireless adapter !! With cell phones increasingly replacing the need for a land line, TIVO hopped on the wagon. The only reason I had a land line was for my TIVO service. With the wireless adapter, I had my land line disconnected and am happy to save that monthly expense.Adapter works great and I've had no problems with it over the last 10 months or so since I purchased it.It was easy to get working !"
889,5,Tivo wireless USB,Very good product. I paid $20 less than the Tivo site was charging. Very happy with this. My signal between PC and Tivo have no problems once I switched to Linksy's router instead of the gateway that came from Verizon.
890,5,Excellent,I have been using my netgear wireless adapter for the last couple of years with some problems here and there. I finally caved in and bought one of these since the price is now under $40.Worked like a charm. Setup and ready to go in 20 minutes or less.Recommended.
891,3,Frustrated,This adapter worked great when i first got it and set up my Tivo.The only problem came in when we decided to secure our internet connection and now my adaptor can't seem to find our Wireless Name and/or use our key1 (password). I sat on the phone with Tivo's service line and they couldn't fix it...or have me fix it.My roommate is able to connect to the new wireless easily but she doesn't have the Tivo Adapter...so not sure if it's my adaptor...or what but i've been frustrated for about a week now with this thing.I'm ready to just go buy a no-name one like she has so it will connect.
892,4,okay product,"it works fine, as good as wired, and better than a phone line. what all it can do depends on what kind of tivo dvr you have. netflix and youtube are only on the series 3 and hd models. but again the tivo wireless adapter itself is great,,,, was worth the amazon price... JJ"
893,1,Don't waste your time or money on this piece of JUNK!,"I won't go into an elaborate diatribe on just how terrible this product is. To sum it up, it's useless and was not market-ready. TiVo customer service and support is abominable, and the ""help"" they supply for this product is laughable. My son has been a network systems engineer for over 10 years, he had to come and try and get it to work. After a bit of fussing with it, the adapter was getting poor reception. The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box, with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof, we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table, and hooked it up to the laptop. Only then were we able to get a decent signal, with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter. Several calls to TiVo got me canned, simple fixes to try. It works best when you throw it in the trash."
894,5,Loved it,"After moving, I didn't have easy access to an ethernet cable anymore. I needed to go wireless and this was the answer. It's cheaper than the same product on the Tivo site and works well."
895,4,"Expensive, but works","I looked into using a wireless router instead of this adapter, but really couldn't find anything (for less money) that seemed worthwhile. The cost is really the only downside to this product; we have two TiVo brand adapters and we've never had a problem with either one."
896,5,great product,"this is a great product! I am very glad I bought it here rather than tivo.com, it saved me $$$...it was easy to set up and didn't take long for tivo to update with it...we have not set up any of the extra features, but when we have time we will. for now, not using the phone line is all we were concerned with (we switched to Vonage)."
897,2,Died 12/29/09 purchased 3/2007,"I have 4 Tivo's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor. I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed. Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly. I giving two stars because it did not last very long. The other WiFi adaptors (Linksys and Microsoft) are still working and they are older. I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot, while the others are not even warm."
898,4,"Works well, easy to setup","The TiVo adapter is practically effortless to install. Once installed, the TiVo Series2 recognizes the adapter easily, then you can walk through the configuration to set it up on the wireless network. The only challenging part is the cumbersome entry of the SSID, due to the TiVo interface for text entry. But once it was configured, it connected OK and is far superior to using the phone line by any means."
899,5,The only way to fly,"I hooked this baby up to a D-Link MIMO wireless router. It connnected immediately and the entire setup took no more than 15 mintutes. Of course, I did ROFM (a little bit). The router is at least 40' away from the adapter and on another level of the house. Reception is great and I'm streaming Live365 programming to my stereo via Tivo as I type this.Highly recommended product."
900,2,Disappointed - No Improvement Over Cheaper Alternatives,"So many people have given this adapter 5 star reviews that I was expecting great things. It didn't happen. This Wireless G adapter gives less signal strength and NO speed improvement over an old $10 Wireless B adapter I'd been using. And yes, I upgraded to Wireless G from my ""send"" unit, and yes, I've got a Tivo with USB 2.0 which should allow faster transfer speeds.In trying to transmit about 35 feet, all on the same floor, through a couple of walls, the best signal strength I can get is about 30%, compared to 45% on an older Dlink adapter. In testing downloads to a Mac, which is really the only reason I wanted a speed boost, there was no improvement at all.I stand in the minority, but I'll just say that the adapter I received is overpriced and underpowered. It's going back."
901,3,The wireless adapter that worked,"Unfortunately there are so many wireless adapters on the market and very few are compatible with my TIVO. This one was and it's more expensive then generic ones from Walmart/Target.I recommend just getting one on the approved list simply b/c I bought like 5-7 different ones from Target/Walwart thinking who cares, I just need a wireless adapter since I have no land line. Only to discover I wasted a lot of time returning them all b/c they didn't work.So just to save time/aggrevation, get one approved on the TIVO website. This one was easiest to find and shipped quick enough (can't go w/o my TV for too long)."
902,5,Tivo Wireless Adapter - Great Product,"I changed out my old (but reliable) Linksys USB adapter for the Tivo 802.11g on my Toshiba Tivo DVR and transfer speeds to PC network improved by two and one half times. Very satisfied - plugged straight in, Tivo recognized the adapter and I was up and running. Nice looking product including dual green LEDs."
903,5,TiVo Wireless Adapter,Pros:Works amazing! Love it. Uses wireless internet connection to upload the show times and titles.Highly suggest this product if your looking for a wireless adapter for your TiVo.Was a plug and play periphrial. Plug it in and your Series2 TiVo finds it right away.Great product and experience. Much like every TiVo product I own.Cons:The price seems a little steep but not too bad because it works like a charms
904,5,works great,It works great and the price was cheaper here at Amazon than what TIVO sells it for on their website.
905,5,simple and easy setup,this adapter is pretty good looking.It practically installed itself.All I had to do was connect the cord and tivo popped put a message that it found a network and guided me thru the rest of the process.I highly recommend it.Lets you enjoy all the web features of tivo.
906,4,"Perfect Stand for the KDS-50A2000, Shelf Height Could be better","Assembly was pretty straight forward, and when you're all done with the TV on top ... looks pretty slick. Strap in back secures TV, and cover in front does the same.Due to support beams in back, my receiver had to go right in the middle on the 2nd shelf. Those same beams, could possibly get in the way of wiring on the top shelf if putting components two across. In fact, I need to get a couple of right-angle connectors in my case. There is also a chance since the glass is at an angle on the sides, that one foot of a componenent all the way to either side may not touch the glass. I also wish the top shelf was a little taller for stacking components.Even with these quibbles, I am very happy with the stand, because the quality is very nice, and the end result looks great & feels solid."
907,2,I thought this book had too much irony in it.,"The Mayor of Casterbridge was a very interesting novel. In my opinion Hardy uses too much irony, and this kills the fun of the whole topic. It is true that every day is filled with irony, but it shouldn't be in somthing someone is reading. the novel also shouldn't be too predictable, I guess that's why Hardy likes irony. If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."
908,3,ok novel,This was an ok novel. It has many plots and twists and is a little hard to follow. The cliff notes make the book much easier to follow.
909,2,Free Kindle Edition is missing a significant portion of Chapter 20.,"The book itself is excellent. Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."
910,2,As plausible as the average soap opera,"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera. Except, none of the characters are likeable.My suggestion: read only the very last line of the book. The book's very existence strives to make this sentiment true."
911,5,One of Hardy's best works,"This is a fabulous book written in classic Hardy style. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises. Just when you think you know where Hardy is leading you, he throws in another detail, which leaves you dumbfounded and believing that no other than Thomas Hardy could pull this off."
912,5,A classic tale of a man's rise and fall,"Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall. A man rising from the ranks of farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and leading citizen of the town. Events of his past emerge to place a shadow over his success, and his greed and some bad judgement lead to his ruin. Like most of Hardy's books, it is a tragedy for the main character."
913,4,My summary of my reading of the Mayor of Casterbridge,"The excellent use of language to desciribe the character and nteractions of the main characters was very polished and held my attention completely throughout. I liked the way the story unfolded, not a ""just so"" tale but one full of true to life human strenths and weakneses. The description of the enviorenment and tracking the history of Casterbridge and he normal day to day life of the enhabiants was interesting and made me feel almost that I was there. I would recommend ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" to any lover of historical novels."
914,1,If you are considering this book...,"IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW! I was forced to read this book for my english class. It was terrible! Sure the plot line, and even some of the characterization was fine, but MY GOD THE DESCRIPTION goes on and on and on and on. Theres almost 4 pages dedicated to describing a building! If I was given the choice between reading this book, or hitting myself in the head with it for the rest of my life, I would go with the hitting on the head one...becuase i'm sure its even less brain-numbing than Hardy's writing."
915,3,Free Kindle Edition is missing part of Chapter 20,"I appreciated the opportunity to read this story using a free download, this being the first book I have read using my new kindle. This is the 1st time I have read this book and its unusual story of a drunken young husband selling his unwanted wife & baby daughter & the following twists & turns of the plot. Unfortunately when I reached chapter 20 I discovered some pages were missing making it difficult for me to follow the story & spoiling my enjoyment. ."
916,4,Characters of Life,"What a story! What a tragedy! The Mayor of Casterbridge faces secrets told and untold, misunderstandings, betrayals, loves won and lost... a bona fide soap opera set in a faraway time! Yes, some of the coincidences are a little too convenient, but they kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning! And in the end I cried. This book's characters help us to consider the effects on others of the way we live our own lives. We are truly sorry for the way the Mayor lived his."
917,1,WHY?,"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for ""fun"". I agree wholeheartedly with the author of ""Classically Boring"" as this book is complete excrement. People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."
918,5,A Dog With Star Power,"""Rhonda Findley and I are the co-authors of New Orleans Unleashed. We created this book, along with the photographer, Vanessa Brown Louvier. There have been some postings giving me more credit than I'm due and suggesting that I was the sole author of the book, which is incorrect. I'd like to clarify that this was a group project. There were no stars, except for Indy the Dog. I hope you all enjoy our wonderful project."""
919,4,Great Voice,"From the first time that I heard her on the Next Friday soundtrack, I was impressed by her voice. Listening to her album, you get to hear a great voice over quality production. To top this off, she did a remake of Guy's ""Let's Chill"" and it is tight. SHe is one of those artist who gives an even mixture of music tempo on her CD. There are ballads, fast tempo and mid tempo on here and the songs have meaning. ""Still Your Son"" and ""She Can't"" same to be personal songs and you feel them. Great CD."
920,3,Decent.,"I bought this album because it was cheap and I hadn't heard of it before. The music is decent...there are only a couple of songs I really like, although I would say the album is decent only because of the material and not the artist...I definately think she can sing."
921,5,IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE,"This book has been one of many great books I have come across it has broadened my mind in so many wonderful ways. My search for truth still continues and not only is this book outstanding but, I do recommend it for those who's' minds are seekers of continuous knowledge."
922,2,Not for agnostics or atheists,"Rev. Teel starts out by telling how he was first a believer, then an agnostic, then an atheist, and finally a true believer, but neglects to say what convinced him in each of those instances. If belief, not reason (as it appears), were behind these conversions, then the premise for this book is reduced in importance and effectiveness. For me, one belief is as good as another. I'd like to hear from a writer convinced by reason and recognized facts, not belief(s)."
923,1,Great title. Poor book.,"It's intriguing: The scriptures that have come down to us really aren't accurate and maybe we should rethink what being a Christian really means. However, this book uses little substantiation for its assertions, preferring, evidently, to be controversial rather than thoughtful. If you really have questions about the ""holy"" bible, please read Bart D. Ehrman's MISQUOTING JESUS. The author's creditials are REAL, his proofs are relatively clear, and his message is more useable: The bible is a human document that has application in our lives. My advice: Continue to be a seeker of Truth...but don't bother buying this book."
924,4,Great,"This is a qood quality vest, and it will work for a festival. I would say that it's more costume quality than I expected, and the gold grommets are pretty noticable. The vest doesn't look as much like suede in person. But my husband really likes it, and he will be wearing it."
925,2,Totally confused,"While I would give the singers somewhat higher marks than Mr. Morrison, he is spot on with everything else. I saw a production of Onegin 2 yrs. ago in Munich that I absolutely hated. Although I disagreed with it's point of view, I understood a great deal of what the director was doing. However with this one I was clueless, time and time again. I must say that I am a big fan of Kwiecien having seen his Don Giovanni (San Francisco) and King Roger (Paris). He is definitely a rising operatic star! Luckily, I was able to see it televised so I didn't waste my money as others have."
926,5,WHAM!,"The only thing better than playing frisbee, is playing frisbee in the dark! Especially when the frisbee glows! I'm no serious diskhead but for some leisurely summer evening fun this is the frisbees knees."
927,5,this book is a certified pageturner`,"I am proud of the way Butch made all that money from the streets and while doing it, he exposes the hypocrisy of the government that tries to bring him down. they charge him with running a criminal enterprise, yet the government controls liquor, ""pharmacueticals"", and cigarettes which is equally or more damaging than heroine. This was a story was really one of the best books Ive ever read, honestly....because its based on a true story. Someone needs to make a movie out of this quick!!! I wonder who would play Butch...."
928,1,Slow performance,I got one of these set up with 4 1TB disk in raid 5 giving me a total og 2.7 TB datastorage. But it is very unstable especialy when handling large or many files +100 MB. The connection is lost and copying has to be restarted.Also streaming runs very slow.When using the build in PnP the mashine hangs and has to be restartet.It is sad as the specs are great.
929,3,Works fine for short periods,"I received the Cunningham clamp on time and it works well for short periods of time. I don't think it is meant to be used for any length of time, as it becomes very uncomfortable. Also could be a hazard to your health!"
930,5,RE code Veronica,"I kind of missed out on this game. I played every RE games well except for the outbreaks and the gameboy version. I didnt have a dreamcase so i couldn't really get this game. Though i did have a PS2, i really didn't pay attention to this game, rather from 1-5. This game is amazing, the graphics is stunning and the hazy structure adds a scary visual to the game. Lots of gameplay hours and fun. Claire is too legit of a character, much like RE2. Claire should make an appearance in the newest RE."
931,1,A shoot yourself movie. Literally!,"This movie blows. You go through the whole movie bored and the least Van Sant could have done was let you see him blow his head up. If I have to see that movie one more time, I'd blow my head off. I mean, everybody that knew of him and followed his music as I did, already knew what happened. I expected a film much better than this one. I agree with one of the other reviewers of a way of Van Sant cashing in Cobain's name. What a loser! Cobain Rules!"
932,2,Makes Elephant seem like an Action Flick.,"Uses the same slow pace as Elephant with een less happening. Too much of a good thing.Wish I could get my hands on the soundtrack, which gives this the 2 stars."
933,1,almost made me want to seek relief.,"I wish I would have rented it before i bought it! Now I am out 20 dollars for a crapy movie. man it Sucked! It was slow, no plot, BORING! The most boring movie this year! It made me feel like I had ADD and didn't want to pay attention anymore, it was so bad, don't waist your money on this one! it makes no sense at all! the best part was the sceanery in the woods! I'd won't be surprised if people kill themselfs after watching this crap!"
934,2,hmmm...,"This film is shot beautifully and I liked the way the actors were allowed to meander around in their character to sort of ""make the movie themselves"" as they went along. Unfortunately the movie is made to be ""About"" the ""last days"" of Kurt Cobain. This movie is not accurate and falls short in paying ANY kind of tribute to the memory of Kurt. It distorts his memory if it does any thing which is sad. I enjoy the quiet scenes and all the mood shots, it's a neat reflective film and is actually comedic at times once you take away any reference there might be to Kurt Cobain. I had to MUTE the volume during the scene where the character tries to sing and play like Kurt. Other than that, like I said I like the way the film is shot and made and would have enjoyed it if it did not have something supposedly to do with Kurt Cobain. Any way, that's what I have to say."
935,1,horrible!!!,"I have to say that I am a pretty big Kurt fan. I was excited when this movie came out because I felt it might actually be pretty good. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt, and thats it!! It was a def. bummer and I had to pull myself through it!! I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this. If you have ever read anything about him you would know this is not what he would have wanted!! All in all take my word for it, this is a waste of money and time!!"
936,1,I want the last 96 minutes of my life back,"This movie is horrible. Don't waste your money buying it or even renting it. COme on, 5 minutes of him staring at something, doing nothing? Or 5 minutes of watching the grass blowing in the wind? Art or not, it sucked horribly."
937,1,Worst.movie.ever.,"Absolute worst movie that I have ever seen, I never write movie reviews but this was so bad and hopelessly boring that I felt obligated to say something......Heres the movie: Guy stumbles around his house mumbling to himself in a dress with a shotgun...treated to a full boyz2men video on a tv...guy stumbles around and sits in a greenhouse mumble mumble...silence and camera focused on a bush for 2 mins...guys drunk friends come to his house guy plays a song 2 guys kiss and lay on eachother in bed...guy makes mac and cheese....guy dies in his greenhouse.....awesome movie....makes me want to watch dude wheres my car"
938,1,Artsy Fartsy,"This movie is poor. Very poor. It seems like some art student got ahold of the idea to do a movie about Kurt, and ""went to town"" with the idea. This movie has NO dialog. I kid you not, NO dialog. I understand what they are trying to do... show all the ""strife"" and ""pain"" Kurt went through with his drug addiction, but this movie draws it out for hours... with no plot. And to any Kurt Cobain novice will have no idea what the hell is going with this movie."
939,1,The Most Boring Michael Pitt Film!!!,"This movie is the worst most boring movie of Michael Pitt's that I have seen. The story is totally dull and boring and hardly any serious and sensible dialogue. Only strange shots of Pitt alone talking to himself and interacting for only a about a minute with one of two of the characters. There was hardly any suspense or spice to this movie. Just downright boring. Do not waste your money or time on this flick. Ain't worth it. Pitt has done much better roles, his best work, FUNNY GAMES."
940,1,Boring,"This movie seems like an exploitation on an idea of what Kurt Cobain's last days may have been like. In the end, it is boring, long, slow, and completely ridiculous."
941,2,What a waste!,"Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched ""The Doors"" too many times. What a waste, another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career. I'd recommend buying any album from Nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows."
942,4,I MISS YOU KURT!,"Welllll, what I can say..this movie is ""DIFFERENT""..GOOD, but DIFFERENT. If you are a TRUE Kurt Cobain/Nirvana fan, you'll learn to appreciate it. It hurts to see this is what Kurt might have gone through! (I HOPE NOT), but the movie itself is very ""QUIET"". He doenst say much. The ""song"" scene"" is the emotional part, Pitt definately played a good role!..I recommend YOU WATCH it..only if you're a TRUE FAN, otherwise, dont waste your time, you wont find it interesting."
943,1,Kurt deserved more than nothing,"One of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Actually I turned it off after about an hour...I don't know why I waited that long. Kurt was such an interesting and enigmatic person, a movie should have been made to pay respect to him or give something of a behind-the-scenes look at him. This movie basically shows Kurt as a wasted heroin addict with nothing more to offer or say or do; lazy film making, terrible camera work. Seriously if you rent this movie after reading this review you have no one to blame but yourself. Literally one of the worst movies ever wasted on film."
944,2,What went wrong here?,"Sadly, Gus Van Sant has stopped directing movies. Instead he has become a supervisor of filming. In the DVD supplemental documentary, the cast goes on and on about how wonderful it was to get to be so creative and work without a script. They rave about how much they loved the improvisation and about how great it was that they were CREATING a work of art. In the end, they didn't create anything but a nauseating bore.I turned the subtitles on just so I could understand what ""Blake"" was muttering (it wasn't worth reading so I turned them back off). The film tries to offer insight into the Kurt Cobain like character but I fail to see how watching him make Macaroni and cheese or crawl around on the floor for five minutes or mumble unitelligable monologues offers an audience anything. GET OVER YOURSELF GUS and start making real films again instead of trying to pass this garbage off as 'ART"""
945,1,BAD ..not good-bad....terrible- bad,very very bad movie...if you watch this you'll be dissapointed...if you buy it you'll be wasting you money. If you recommend this you are the anti-christ.
946,4,PEARL JAM SUCKS!!!,"I live in Seattle and I cant see why anyone could ever talk crap about dear ol Kurt and put him down,He was the nicest guy and cared more about other people than himself.I saw Nirvana in concert in Oct.93 in Phx,Az were I used to live and when I saw Kurt play and sing it was perfect without a flaw.It hurts me that anyone could ever talk about Kurt like he was just nothing or over rated,Where in the hell were you in 94 you fool, Nirvana changed the whole world and you sit ther and say he had no talent.If it wasnt for Nirvana & Kurt ther would be no Lame bandwagon Pearl Jam."
947,2,Dissapointed...,"I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater. I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry, Michael Pitt is the wrong choice to play Kurt Cobain (even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician). The trouble is, I don't think anyone could really play Kurt. I suppose there are people in this movie (Kim Gordan of Sonic Youth and the director Gus Van Sant) who actually knew Kurt while he was alive, so they know something I don't obviously. Regardless of the mis-casting, in my opinion, the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless. We already know how it's going to end (like with ""Elephant"") but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes. I admire Van Sant's lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero Kurt, but it just falls short in the end."
948,2,Last Days,"I can't make up my mind, this is an awful movie to watch, but in reality probably quite close to the truth of how the last few days of a man about to kill himself is likely to have been. There are no suprises, no meaningful insights. If Gus Van Sant was trying to guess what the last few days of a drug addicted, depressed man may have been like, that being: depressing, dull, meaningless, lonely, then he succeeded. Its unlikely that anyone would enjoy this film, and maybe you aren't supposed to....."
949,1,This movie is not NIRVANA,"Gus Van Zant should really be ashamed of himself for producing this film . Visually, sure, it is great looking. However, his vision of this Kurt Cobain Character is nothing more than a stumbling mumbling half wit with no personality or reason for being on screen. This movie is an insult to the Real Cobain, Nirvana, and all of the Nirvana fans. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. It is garbage and has absolutely no business even being mentioned in the same breath as Nirvana, Cobain, or music in general."
950,1,What a disappointment...,"Last Days was easily the worst movie I have seen since Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag. From start to finish, it was disjointed and each scene was entirely too long. In fact, I watched the last 30 minutes of the move in 10x speed and didn't miss a thing!Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters. You don't really even know Blake is a troubled musician (as it says in the synopsis) until half way through the movie, so you spend time watching him mope around the house in, what appears to be, a drug-induced stupor. But you really don't know what's wrong with him and it's not very interesting to watch.I had high hopes for this movie, especially after watching the making of it in the Special Features section, but it was a complete waste of time."
951,2,it makes u cry,"TEARS of anger.tears of anger that is.i think kurt deserves more respect than this boring movie.I am hoping that in a near future, One director would have thecourage to make a film based on Tom Grant's investigation.WATCH COURTNEY AND KURT INSTEAD, DONT WASTE UR MONEY.Justice for kurt . we miss u and love u."
952,1,The worst movie I've seen ever! Awful!,"I have never been so compelled to review anything until I watched the movie Last Days yesterday evening. The movie was about absolutely nothing. The character who is supposed to be Cobain just mumbled, walked around, and passed out the entire movie. It was awful and a complete waste of my time. I was seriously angry after watching it, because I stayed up to watch it. How does this crap ever make it?"
953,1,He can't even make macaroni and cheese,"Wouldn't it have been nice if the _not_ Kurt had gone with Kim Gordon? He could've been a member of the family. How cool would that be to have Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore as parents? Kurt could have sat on the floor surrounded by kittens,making drawings of sperm and embryos with crayons.this over indulgent pile might as well have been about nothing at all, instead ol' Gus decided to cash in on Kurts name. the real question is, why not? everyone else did."
954,1,Don't Watch It / Don't Buy It,"Whether or not this movie is based on Kurt Cobain it is still the most boring and horrendous film I have ever seen. In fact, I could watch it all the wat through because nothing happened. Sorry Gus your career has gone out wirh a bang."
955,1,If there was a negative star rating....,"Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's time out of my life that I will never get back. My thought, after it was all over, was how could he not be thoroughly embarrassed having something this incredibly useless out for public consumption with his name on it? Unless you're obsessed with Curt Cobain and would watch anything remotely having to do with him, just don't bother."
956,1,Last Days should be called Last Time,"Because the first time you watch it will undoubtly be your last as well. Overall I believed I was going to be watching a movie loosely based on the life of Kurt Cobain leading up to his death.Instead what I was ""graced"" with is Blake (Kurt) sitting in a creek, sitting by the lake, sitting against a door and so on and so on. Half the time you're just looking at a still object with no characters on screen. There was a plot somewhere in there too but with all the MUMBLING you might miss it. Not to mention that there isn't that much dialogue to begin with.I wouldn't recommend this movie to Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fans.This movie bored me tears, I barely finished it."
957,1,"Sucked really bad, not even a rental...","This movie was by far the worst I have ever seen, I had to fast forward most of it, as it was painfully drug out. You would be better off constipated, sitting on the throne with a comic book instead of watching this load of garbage.Eastcoast Phil.TCBRN."
958,2,man I really wanted to like this movie,"First off I would like to say that I love Nirvana's music I have every CD, but I really hated this movie. Kurt would be really disappointed someone even made a movie about him and he would probably be more pissed that it sucked. He was an extreamly talented musician and he deserves to be remembered way better than the way the decided to portray him. I also beleive he did not kill himself but was murdered. Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, also a very good band, recently stated she beleives kurt was murdered. The fact is though that Gus Van Sant made a terrible movie. Anyone of you trying to force yourselves into beleiving you like this movie don't cheat yourselves you know it was so bad no one could really enjoy it. Even if you are a big fan of Kurt or Van Sant this was bad. If nothing else Kurt tried to teach us to come as we are so don't try to force yourselves to like a horrible movie for the sale of Kurt or Van Sant. I hope this helped someone.thanks zack"
959,1,What is this?,"Ok, I must say I am a huge fan of Nirvana and Kurt's work, but this film......it was interesting if you're willing to sit and watch nothing. This film was about Kurt's last days and what he did, but it was a terrible thing to watch if your a fan because you get absolutely nothing out of it. Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible? I must say I don't think any fan of Nirvana should watch this.Also the very end of the movie says:In memory ofKurt Cobain1967-1994This movie should not have been in memory of Kurt."
960,2,TRUST ME - DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE - THIS IS JUNK,"Maybe this is how Kurt Cobain spent his ""last days"" but this does not mean it is a good film. This is just another stylish psuedo-intellectual art-house film. Gus Van Sant is quickly becoming like Stephen Sodenberg. A guy trying to make cool artsy flicks that seem really deep in meaning to the very niave watcher, but, like Sodenberg, anyone who even bothers to tread deep into an analysis of this film is apt to feel cheated and tricked. Gus Van Sant even attempts to lift the whole significance of the grunge-scene but this movie just seems so contrived and silly. Like it is looking for some significance to everything when there is none. Just buy another Nirvana album. Don't even bother."
961,1,"Ultimately, a beautiful failure","Brilliant cinematography fails to mend this meditation on the last days of Kurt Cobain. It's a frustrating experience that can be rewarding, but ultimately leaves you empty."
962,2,"Interesting methodology, Uninteresting result","As others have commented, the dreary humdrum of ""Last Days"" feels more authentic (and sad) than a typical Hollywood rendering of the same. I suppose there is art in the sheer guts to make a portrayal so bleak, so real. But having said that, to want to invest 90 minutes of one's time in such a story, one has to actually care about the protagonists. In this case, there isn't any set-up, no reason to care. In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them). When the end came, I just didn't care anymore. If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy. It was a blessing.Postscript: it would be nice to see van Sant make a movie that identifies with real human beings rather than the drugged characatures of Last Days or My Own Private Idaho. Those folks . . . just let them die. We don't need them here."
963,2,"rushed to watch, turned off twice","the film ""last days"" for me was a one watch wonder. i am unsure if it will ever make it off the shelf and back into the player..."
964,1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I had to continually watch it because I was falling asleep over and over again. Boring, uninteresting, and bias! Completely horrible and the only reason I watched it was for my true love of Kurt Cobain! I would not even give it a star if I had the choice."
965,1,boring,i was expecting at least a pace that would keep me until the end but nada...except the costumes the movie was blank for me
966,5,Great curriculum for preschoolers!!,This is a wonderful wealth of curriculum for parents who are interested in teaching their preschoolers! It has wonderful Christian resources and I highly recommend it!
967,2,publishing mix-up?,"I love Chekhov; this review has nothing to do with the value of his writing. It's with the Dover Thrift Edition. Two-thirds of the way through the book, around p. 72 or so, Chekhov ends and ""Kubla Khan"" or some other random poem begins (I don't have the book here with me and I've forgotten the poem by now). It's bizarre. I'm missing three stories and the end of a fourth. I'm sure this is just a freak mistake and most other copies won't have this flaw, but this particular book wasn't quite as useful to me as I had hoped. Unless I want to read ""Kubla Khan."""
968,3,"Good selection, miserably edited","A good instroduction to Chekhov, for those who are not put off by terrible editing and some amusing failures at English. This whole series runs the gamut. The very old translations come off well enough to give a good picture of some of Chekhov'sbest stories, hopefully whetting the appetite for more."
969,3,Typical Chekhov,"Great, here are 5 short stories. If you like this sort of thing, you'll be happy; if not, you'll be bogged down by the incredibly long Russian names and bored by the recurring themes of poor peasants, harsh life, etc. Not a great introduction to Chekhov. Read this only if you're a fan"
970,3,OK but that is about it,"This is a decent harness for the money but not nearly as good as a fully adjustable leather harness. The quality is OK. Not junk but certainly not a premium item either. Downsides compared to my leather harness(which walked off-hence the replacement). 1) it is designed for flat heads. The top loop is really short so it sits high on my head. Feels like it wants to slide off my head when I am tilted forward. 2) The top strap does not adjust 3) there is no swivel on the side straps so it twists during reps and in doing so scrapes up and down your face. 4) the chain is kinda small-both links and distance. If you can afford it, I suggest getting a better leather or iron mind strap. Otherwise this will work OK, just don't expect too much."
971,2,Not very heavy duty,"The one I was shipped was junk. It broke the first time I put 25 pounds on it. One of the straps that hangs past the ear tore right off. One of the pictures above shows a guy with two red Olympic plates on the thing. The red plates are 25 Kilos each, that's 110 pounds. Frankly, I wouldn't trust the hardware on this thing with that much weight. It broke in such a way that I can still use mine, and it'll be a good long while before I'm putting 110 pounds on one of these, so I'm going to keep using it. However, if I had it all to do over again I'd trade up for a better one."
972,3,not bad,"This is very sturdy, but really feels awkward if you're doing full neck movements. I think the towel like in the pic is a good idea, but it's really annoying to do that. It chafes my ears. Also, I'm much buffer than the dude in the picture."
973,3,OK,Well built. I wish the top strap was adjustable. I rigged mine with a chin strap for full range flexions.
974,2,different from picture shown,Product recieved doesn't look nothing like the photo shown. It's full nylon and the quick link doesn't even fit on the chain. It doesn't even come close to fitting.
975,3,OVERWRITTEN MYSTERY,This is basically a genre novel written by a literary master. Faulkner uses his experimental technique to bad effect here as it does not give weight to the story and in fact undrmines it. The race relations angle often expressed through Charles and Gavin is actually the best part of the book
976,2,If it's William Faulkner it must be good.,"I read this on my own and have read other works by Faulkner, so I'm not just some innocent student.On the positive: Faulkner does create good imagery such as the two scenes in the graveyard. I also like that he never tries to explain himself, let's the reader figure it out. The symbolism is OK if you're into that sort of thing.On the negative: He must have written this while out and out drunk and the editor, publisher and the adoring public make great allowance because this is ""William Faulkner"". The sentences are not just run-on, but change subjects midstream and simply make no sense. The dialogue is the same as the narrative except for the quotes surrounding it and thus since everyone talks the same, there is not much for characterization. The plot is a simple mystery which depends on timing, coincidence, stupidity and is just unbelievable.If not for the fame of the author, this book would be forgotton."
977,2,Never read Bukowski and Faulkner back to back,"Why is Faulkner considered a classic writer. Who sets the standards? Intruder in the Dust is a prime example on how to fail English Comp 101. His run on sentences are dull, unispiring, and two pages long. It's exhausting! If you want to read long sentences, read Kerouac. Ditch Faulkner!!"
978,2,Confusing and Convoluted,"As a sophomore in high school nearly 10 years ago, I had a terrible experience with this book. The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the ""long sentence"" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: ""I'm trying to be literate, not literary."" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."
979,1,Difficult Read,"This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about. I have read and reread the story, but still have difficulty summarizing the story. The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow. Use caution when reading this story."
980,1,um.. and the point of this was??????,"I am going to be a freshmen in high school. This book was on my summer reading list and as I began to read it it's flow totally lost ME IN THE DUST!!! I am not stupid, in fact I am in the top 99 percentile of all kids in my grade across the U.S. After having to write down all the characters and list their traits i believe that I can grasp a few chunks of this novel. O well.Yeah, just don't even try this book."
981,1,Bilge,"I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. ""A Light in August"" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated."
982,1,Read...at your own caution!,"I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the ""laws"" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS!"
983,1,An Insult to the English Language,"I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust."
984,1,WHAT!?!?!?!?!,I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AS A MANDATORY OUTSIDE READING BOOK FOR MY 11TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. I AM ON CHAPTER THREE AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON EXACTLY. FAULKNER'S USE OF WORDING IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND DOES NOT CAPTURE THE READER AT ALL.ALONG WITH READING THE BOOK WE HAVE TO COMPLETE A PROJECT EXPLAINING THE PLOT AND MAIN THEMES. HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD.
985,2,Too Long,"Thanks to its stream-of-conscious narrative, this book leans more toward the incomprehensible side of Faulkner's canon, despite a simple plot that often feels as if it would have been suited to a short story and was dragged out to fit the necessary length for a full-length book. When you add to that the blatant preachiness and, aside from the inciting event, a predictable storyline, this book ends up being more work than its worth."
986,2,Second rate Faulker,"This novel doesn't rank with Faulkner's classic work and there are dozens of reviews here that tell why--but the most basic problem is the difficulty of writing a mystery, a plot-driven story, in prose that is often gibberish."
987,4,A personal favorite,"Panned by critics and written strictly to make money, I still find the story compelling and Faulkner's treatment of it excellent."
988,2,Concerned about the number of errors,"I bought this to review for my 4th round of taking the boards. On the areas that I am well versed in, I have found a number of errors. I have verified these with other sources . This makes me worry about the accuracy on the topics that I need help. I have also found similar problems with their online questions.After this, I bought the new edition of Swanson's ReviewSwanson's Family Medicine Reviewwhich thankfully does not seem to suffer from the same problems."
989,3,"Many mistakes, no contact, no website, but easy to read","There are many mistakes in the new 2010 edition. Several of the questions on the pre-test do not even have the correct answer as an option. There is an email given for questions and concerns, but it is not a functioning email address, at least not at this point. I thought maybe there was a way to get corrections but there is no way make contact. If corrections become available, the book will be very valuable. Also, the website offered does not exist, at least not yet (it claims it will be up by January 31, 2011). There are many errors, but it is very well written and easy/fun to read, with great coverage of topics on the boards.But it makes me nervous that I might not pick up all the mistakes, and learn some of the wrong things!"
990,2,Don't waste your money - buy 3rd edition used.,"The back cover states ""Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition"". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged. And I suspect the same will be true for the 4 online practice exams. Bottom line - buy the 3rd edition used for about $2 and save yourself $60. Still, this book is ok for FP boards as is Swanson's."
991,4,The book was good but the test bank was down,"I thought that the book was a great review for the test and saw much of the material on the test. However, the test bank was down the week before my exam which was when I wanted to do the questions. That was very disappointing, but I did the test questions on the AAFP website which were both helpful and provided CME credit as well.Addendum: I just got my scores today, and I rocked the boards! I ended up in the 95th percentile. I also attended a course, but I felt that this book really put me over the top. It was great at some of the esoterica on the boards. My only beef is that I could not gain access to the online questions at all. Mine did not come with a CD, you had to log onto a website with a number provided in the front of the book. The week before my exam the website was down completely. I ended up not needing it, but it did stress me out right before the boards. Good luck and buy this book!!!"
992,4,Good board review material,"I have tried board review courses, CD-ROMs and other board review books in the past. This one hits all the important subjects you'll find on the actual exam in a format very similar to the exam itself. I would recommend it and plan on using it again for future exam recertifications."
993,3,beware some info not up to date,"This is a good starting point for board reviews. It reminds you of what topics you should brush up on. For the price, a lot cheaper than spending money and time on review courses. However, some of the material is WAY out of date! References for answers can date back to 1990s. Medicine changes rapidly so this is not acceptable for me. I studied this with my laptop by my side so I could look up the CURRENT recommendations for certain conditions/medication usage, etc. But why am I having to do this work when they could just have easily looked up the same information I have access to each time they spit out a new edition?!"
994,1,Quickstart? Maybe a different title is more appropriate,"This book is quite long, has lackluster coverage of major 9.0 features, and has several errors. I found myself trying to use it as a reference guide becuase of the size, but digging around for any useful information was almost always futile. Other books in this series seem to be tighter and more coherent than this overlong book."
995,1,Waste of money,This book is the worst tutorial Illustrator book out there. It doesn't explain how or why. Not a good book for those new to Illustrator like I am.
996,4,Love It,"This is a great CD. Repin is a great player, and he does justice to all the compositions. The Lalo is wonderfull, although the last movement is not totaly clean, the style is great and it is a great listen. The Chausson does not have enough tension, and the overdone reverbration is obvious. The Ravel is strong, but it doesn't beat the Heifetz version!"
997,5,An excellent performance,There is a tendency to write of the musicians of bond as fluff because they are provocative in the way they dress.Like most young people these girls are aware of their sexuality but what I hear in the music is professionals who take their music very seriously.I often listen to this DVD at work and when I can't watch the concert I run the program in the background while I have something else on the screen and I enjoy the performance just as much.A definite recommend!
998,4,Overall enjoyable...but,"Overall, I find this DVD quite enjoyable as ""the Duel"", ""dallas"", ""bond theme"" ""alexander the great"" and ""victory"" simply blew me away. However, at the same time, their other compositions don't quite work for me, as they were over-orchestrated. It is overall interesting though, as the four violinists are very talented."
999,5,Good for Violin Lover Starters,"I heard about BOND with my nephew and I fall in love with these group! They bond to my heart and my fascination of violin music. This is a new concept in violin performance. I recommend this DVD, because you can enjoy music and see the passion of the performance of these girls. I buy a new violin. My children see it and play with them the violin, dance and sing. I am going to buy other BOND presentation. It is a good choice.Vivian"
